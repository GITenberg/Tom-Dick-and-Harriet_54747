<small>A MEETING ON THE ICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There had been almost a week of zero
weather and the Hudson River in the neighborhood
of Coleville and Ferry Hill was frozen
hard and fast from shore to shore. They were
cutting ice below Coleville, and Dick Somes had
watched them for some time before crossing the
river in the teeth of a bitter east wind and reaching
the shelter of the opposite shore. There, with
the trees protecting him from the icy blast, he
turned up-stream once more and skated more
leisurely along the margin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the middle of an afternoon in early January,
to be exact, the third day of the new year;
and overhead sunlight and clouds held alternate
sway. But the sun, already nearing the summit
of the distant hills, held little warmth even when
it managed to escape for a moment from the flying
banks of cloud, and Dick, accustomed though
he was to the intense cold of the western mountains
and prairies, was glad to escape for a while
from that biting wind which apparently entertained
not the slightest respect for his clothing
and which numbed him through and through.</p>

<p>The river was nearly deserted. Directly across
from him, nearly a half-mile away, a few skaters
were to be seen keeping to the smooth ice near
shore. A mile below black specks moved about in
front of the big ice-houses. But for the rest, Dick
had the river to himself. Or, at least, so he
thought until, rounding a slight curve, he caught
sight of a figure seated on the edge of the bank.
Perhaps the wind whipping the tops of the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
drowned the ring of Dick’s skates, or perhaps the
girl with the brown sweater, gray skirt and white
tam-o’-shanter was too much absorbed with the
broken skate strap in her hand to heed anything
else. At least, she was unaware of Dick’s approach,
and so that youth had ample opportunity
to observe his discovery as he skated
slowly along.</p>

<p>Under the white tam-o’-shanter was a good
deal of very red hair, and under the red hair was
a pretty, healthy face with rosy cheeks, an impertinent
little up-tilted nose, a pair of clear blue
eyes and a small mouth which, just at this moment,
was pursed in a pout of annoyance to match
the frown on her forehead. The hanging skate
and the broken strap told their tale and Dick, on
his way past, wheeled and slid up to the distressed
maiden.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“Hello,” he said. “Break your strap?”</a></p>

<p>The girl looked up with a start and studied him
a moment in silence. Then she tossed the longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
piece of the offending leather to him and he caught
it deftly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “just look at the old thing!
And I haven’t another and I’m half a mile from
home. Roy told me I ought to have the other kind
of skates and you can just wager I’m going to
after this!”</p>

<p>“Well, you could have one of my straps,” answered
Dick, “only I don’t wear them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I could pick one off the trees only
they don’t grow there,” she answered sharply.
Dick laughed and in a moment the girl joined him.</p>

<p>“I dare say it’s a joke,” she said, “but when
you come out to skate you don’t just like to have
to sit on a rock and hold your foot in your hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can fix you up,” said Dick carelessly.
“Here, wait a minute.” He drew off his gloves,
tossed them with the broken strap on to the bank
and drew the neck of his sweater down. “Out
our way we generally mend things with barbed
wire, but there doesn’t seem to be any handy, so
I guess this’ll do until you get home.” With a
final tug he brought forth a blue four-in-hand
necktie and held it forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_5">“‘Hello,’ he said. ‘Break your strap?’”</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8-<br />9]</a></span></p>

<p>“But—but that’s your tie!” protested the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t need it. Besides, it’s old.”</p>

<p>“It looks brand-new,” answered the girl.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “Put your foot
out, please.”</p>

<p>“But it’ll spoil it, won’t it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t care if it does. I’ve got lots more,
and I never liked this one anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Well—” She put out the foot with the disabled
skate and Dick substituted the blue necktie
for the broken strap. When the skate was
once more firmly in place and a nice blue bow-knot
adorned the instep of her shoe the girl broke
into laughter.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it lovely?” she cried, wriggling her foot
around and viewing it at all angles. “Think of
wearing neckties on your feet! I do wish I had
one for the other foot too!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sorry I haven’t any more,” laughed Dick.
“How would a handkerchief do?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, I tried using my handkerchief, but it
wasn’t big enough. Cold, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Awfully.” She got to her feet and tried the
skate. It held well and she turned a grateful
countenance to Dick. “I’m very much obliged,”
she said sweetly; “and I’ll send the tie to you—or
another one like it—when I get home. Do
you live around here? I’ve never seen you before,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” he answered. “I don’t
want it. You’ll have to go kind of easy with it,
though, I guess, or it’ll get loose.” He rescued
his gloves and drew them on his chilled fingers.
“I’ll go along with you, if you like, in case it
comes undone.”</p>

<p>“I asked you a question,” she replied imperiously.
He looked at her amusedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you did,” he said. “You asked if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
lived around here, didn’t you?” The girl’s head
went into the air and the corners of her mouth
came down.</p>

<p>“If you don’t care to answer, I’m sure you
needn’t,” she said haughtily. Dick laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind. I live over there.” He
nodded across the river. “I’m at Hammond
Academy.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the girl. “You talk as though you
weren’t ashamed of it!”</p>

<p>“Ashamed of it?” he repeated in a puzzled way.
“Why should I be? Isn’t Hammond all right?”</p>

<p>“For those who like it,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t like it,” he laughed. “Why
not?”</p>

<p>“Because—because—” She stopped and drew
the collar of her brown sweater higher about her
neck. “I’m going now,” she announced. “I
don’t think you need come. I’m very much
obliged. And I’ll send the necktie to you at
Hammond.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who are you going to send it to?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh! That’s so, who is it? I don’t want to
know your name, but if you like to tell me—”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I saw you first,” he said. “You tell me your
name and then I’ll tell you mine.”</p>

<p>The girl in the brown sweater had started off
and Dick had taken his place beside her. For a
moment they skated in silence. Then:</p>

<p>“I’m Harry Emery,” she announced.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he answered indifferently. “And do
you live around here?” She turned upon him in
surprise.</p>

<p>“You’re just pretending!” she said after a
moment’s examination of his countenance.</p>

<p>“Pretending what?”</p>

<p>“That you don’t know who I am. Why, every
Hammond boy knows the girl that beat their best
skater last winter!”</p>

<p>“Did you do that?” he asked in admiration.
“I’ll bet you couldn’t do it this winter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t believe you could beat me.”</p>

<p>“Want to try it?” she challenged. He shook
his head.</p>

<p>“Not while you’ve got one skate strapped on
with a necktie,” he answered. “But if you think
you’d like a race some time you let me know.”</p>

<p>She looked him over speculatively and what
she saw must have impressed her a little, for
there was a note of uncertainty in her voice when
she said:</p>

<p>“I guess I could beat you, Mr. Conceit. I beat
Schonberg last winter. Can you skate faster
than he can?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I never saw him.”</p>

<p>“Never saw him!” she cried. “How long have
you been at Hammond?”</p>

<p>“Since about this time yesterday,” he replied
smilingly.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said. “You’ve just come? You
weren’t there in the fall?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Just got here yesterday afternoon and wish
I was back where I came from,” he answered
cheerfully. “There’s only about a dozen fellows
over there and they’re the no-accountest lot I
ever did see. I didn’t know when the new term
began and so I just moseyed up here to find out.
It doesn’t start until the day after to-morrow.
Maybe by that time I’ll get sick of it and pull
my freight for home.”</p>

<p>“Run away, do you mean?” asked Harry Emery
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, just change my mind. I haven’t paid
my tuition yet, and I guess I could light out if I
wanted to, any time before school begins. And
I’ve got a good mind to do it.”</p>

<p>“Serves you right for not going to a—well,
another school!” said the girl.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. But I didn’t know. Dad’s
lawyer in New York knew about Hammond
and said it was all right. So I came up. Maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
I’ll like it better when the rest of the fellows get
back.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t,” answered Harry decidedly.
“Why didn’t you come to our school?”</p>

<p>Dick looked amused.</p>

<p>“Is it a girl’s school?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course not, silly! It’s Ferry Hill, and
everybody who knows anything says it’s the best
school around here; the best school anywhere!”</p>

<p>“Oh, boys and girls both, eh? I don’t think
I’d like that.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it? But if you go there—?”</p>

<p>“I don’t go to school there; I just live there.
My father is the Principal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now I savvy,” said Dick. “Where is it?
Is it nice? I’d like to take a look at it.”</p>

<p>“It’s just up here a bit further,” answered
Harry. “You can see it from Hammond.
Haven’t you noticed?” Dick shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s on a hill,” continued Harry, “and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
would have seen it if you weren’t blind. It’s
the nicest school there is, and the boys are dandy.
And we can beat Hammond at anything—foot-ball,
base-ball, tennis, hock—well, not hockey, maybe,
but we’ve only played one year; but we’ll beat
them this year, at that, too!”</p>

<p>“Sounds like the real thing,” laughed Dick.
“How big is it!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s smaller than Hammond,” Harry
acknowledged grudgingly, “but it—it’s more
select! There are forty-two boys this year; there
were forty-three last season when Otto Ferris was
here.”</p>

<p>“What happened to him?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“He got sick and went home. I’m glad of it;
I hate him.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what you do,” said Dick after a
moment. “You show me what your school is like.
Maybe if I get any more soured on Hammond I’ll
skate over with my trunk and try Ferry Hill.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” cried Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“But—but you couldn’t!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes I could. I can do as I like, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But they wouldn’t let you!”</p>

<p>“Who wouldn’t let me?”</p>

<p>“They—them—over at Hammond!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see them try and stop me,” answered
Dick with a laugh. “I haven’t entered
their school yet, you know, and I don’t owe them
anything but a day’s board and lodging. You
produce your school, Miss Emery, and I’ll look
it over.”</p>

<p>“And if you like it you’ll come?” cried Harry,
her blue eyes dancing. Dick hesitated, then:</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll come if I like it!” he answered.</p>

<p>“Promise?”</p>

<p>“Promise.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then!” cried Harry. “I’ll race you
to the boat-house!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>DICK SOMES IS PERSONALLY CONDUCTED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">I don’t think Dick tried very hard to win that
race; at least, he exhibited no superhuman efforts;
and the result was that Harry Emery won
by several yards, finishing on one skate and trailing
a blue streamer from the other foot like a
banner of victory. She subsided on the edge of
the boat-house porch, smiling and triumphant.</p>

<p>“I won!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Easily,” answered Dick placidly.</p>

<p>“I told you I could,” continued Harry.</p>

<p>“I said so too, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“No, you said I couldn’t; you know you did.”</p>

<p>“Guess I was wrong then.” There was a moment’s
silence during which they each busied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
themselves with their skates. Presently Harry
laid hers beside her and looked up with a frown.</p>

<p>“No, you were right,” she sighed. “I guess
you can beat me. You weren’t trying just now.
You’re like everybody else; you think because
I’m a girl I’m not worth bothering with.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You skate finely,” answered Dick
earnestly. “Better than any girl I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Any girl!” echoed Harry scathingly. “That’s
it! Girls can’t skate! Why, there isn’t one at
Madame Lambert’s who can keep up with me for
a minute. I can skate faster than any boy here,
too!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s doing pretty well, isn’t it?”
asked Dick with a smile as he tossed his skates
down beside hers.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to be beaten—by any one,” grieved
Harry.</p>

<p>“Then you mustn’t race with me.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! You’d be polite and let me beat you—as
you did just now. I—I hate polite people!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t,” said Dick grimly. “When
you race with me you’ve got to go as hard as you
know how, for I’ll beat you if I can. And if you
can’t stand being beaten you want to keep out of
it, Miss Emery.”</p>

<p>Harry studied him a moment in silence.</p>

<p>“I guess nobody likes to be beaten,” she said
finally; “but I can stand it as well as the next fellow.
What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Somes, Dick Somes; Richard for long.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Harriet ‘for long,’” she laughed.
“But nobody calls me Harriet; it isn’t a very
pretty name, is it?”</p>

<p>“Harriet? I don’t believe I ever heard it before.
I was wondering how you came to be named
Harry. Harry suits you better, I guess.”</p>

<p>“How old are you, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Sixteen last August.”</p>

<p>“I’m fifteen. Wouldn’t you think I was
older?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Heaps,” he laughed. “I thought you were
about twenty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t like to be made fun of,” replied Harry.</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal you don’t like, isn’t
there?” he asked with a grin.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t like you if you talk like that,” she
answered severely.</p>

<p>“Then I sha’n’t come to your old school.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t an ‘old school!’” flashed Harry.
“And I don’t care whether you come or not!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do,” he answered soothingly. “If
I don’t come we won’t have that race.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to race you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Then it’s me for Hammond
again. I guess it’s the better school of the two,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’ll suit you better,” she answered
angrily. Then she caught sight of the merriment
in his eyes, hesitated and laughed softly. “You—you
almost made me angry,” she declared.</p>

<p>“Almost, eh? Then you must be a terror, Miss
Emery, when you go the limit. Aren’t you going
to show me around? It’s getting late and I’m
freezing to death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on,” answered Harry. “You can leave
your skates here; they’ll be all right. And here’s
your tie. I’m afraid, though, it’s kind of frazzled
and—oh, it’s torn! Look!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you care,” he said. “Here, I’ll carry
your skates.”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered decisively, “I’ll carry
them myself. I don’t like to be waited on.”</p>

<p>“I guess if I came here to school,” laughed
Dick, “it would take most of my time finding out
what you didn’t like. I wouldn’t have any time
for lessons.”</p>

<p>“Do you like to study?” Harry asked.</p>

<p>“Pretty well; everything but languages. Which
way do we go? Up this path?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Oh, I forgot. That’s the boat-house
there. We have a crew and we race Hammond
every spring. Last year we were beaten.”</p>

<p>“I never saw a boat race,” said Dick. “It must
be good sport.”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly great,” said Harry, “and awfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
exciting! This is the Grove and the buildings
are up the hill, only you can’t see them yet.
I’ll go ahead and show you the way.”</p>

<p>The path wound through a thick growth of
trees, maples and oaks and others, climbing steadily
upward. Presently the trees thinned and
ceased and Dick followed his guide through a gap
in a breast-high hedge which, as Harry informed
him, marked “inner bounds.” I have no intention
of recording the fund of information which
Harry showered upon Dick’s defenseless head.
Needless to say that she colored her remarks with
the rose-tint of enthusiasm and drew a most alluring
picture of life at Ferry Hill. She rattled on
breathlessly and continuously after she had once
become warmed up to her task and Dick’s brain
began to reel under the torrent of information.</p>

<p>He was shown Burgess Hall, with the dormitories
and the dining-room, School Hall, with its
twilighted class rooms, the Cottage, where Harry
lived—Harry pointed out her room and described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the furnishings minutely, even to the pink paper
on the walls—and the Gymnasium, which was
locked, and consequently remained a mystery for
the present. Back of the gym a gate in the hedge
gave access to the Athletic Field, with its snow-filled
stands and gibbet-like goal-posts rising forlornly
out of the white waste. Harry said there
was a running track there, but Dick had to take
her word for it. Then they retraced their steps
and Harry pointed out, at a distance, the stables
and barns and the orchard beyond.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you my menagerie some time,” she
said. “It lives in the barn. I’ve got a parrot,
three lovely Angora kittens, a squirrel, four guinea-pigs,
six rabbits, lots and lots of white mice,
heaps of pigeons, and a dog.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” said Dick. “Is that all?”</p>

<p>“The dog’s name is Snip,” Harry continued.
“He’s a fox terrier. Last year I had two black
rabbits and I called them Pete and Repeat, and
then there was a third and I had to call it Threepete.
Isn’t that silly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it’s a pretty good name,” laughed
Dick.</p>

<p>“Really? The parrot’s name is Methuselah;
he’s awfully old, I guess, but he’s a perfect dear.
You’ll love Methuselah, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I don’t believe so. I don’t like
parrots.”</p>

<p>“But he isn’t just—just an ordinary parrot,”
said Harry earnestly. “He’s awfully clever and
wise; he knows heaps of things, really!”</p>

<p>“I like dogs and horses better,” answered Dick.
“Have you got a horse?”</p>

<p>“No, there are two in the stable, but they don’t
belong to me. Next year, though, papa is going to
get me a pony and a cart. Then I shall drive to
school every day.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your school?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“Over there at Silver Cove. It’s a very nice
school.”</p>

<p>They had reached the dormitory again and
Dick stopped and looked about him. It was getting
dark rapidly and the campus, deep with snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
looked bleak and forlorn. Even Harry had to
acknowledge that fact to herself and her hopes of
inducing Dick to cast his lot with Ferry Hill began
to dwindle. Westward, above the tops of the trees
which crowded the slope, lay the frozen river, and
beyond, on the farther bank, a few yellow points
of light marked the location of Coleville and Hammond
Academy.</p>

<p>“Of course,” ventured Harry, “things don’t
look very nice now, but you ought to see them
when the trees are out and—and all.”</p>

<p>But her voice didn’t hold much conviction and
Dick merely nodded his head as he turned toward
the path down the slope.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m much obliged for showing me
around,” he said. “I’d better be getting back.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Harry. “I—I’ll walk down to
the river with you. You might lose your way.”
She didn’t have the courage to ask him whether
he liked Ferry Hill well enough to come there.
She didn’t believe he did. She wished he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
have seen it in the morning when the sun was
shining warmly on the red brick walls and the sky
was blue overhead. She was disappointed. Dick
seemed a rather nice sort, if somewhat too—too
self-assured, and it would have pleased Harry
hugely to have wrested a prospective student away
from the rival school. Besides, the sum of money
which the advent of another student meant was
not to be sneered at; Ferry Hill’s expenses so
nearly matched her income that a half-year’s
tuition and board might mean quite a little when
the accounts were balanced. Doctor Emery, as
Harry well knew, had been rather discouraged
for the last two or three years. There was only
the one dormitory hall and forty-six boys filled it
to overflowing, and for that many students the
expense was as great as it would be for twice the
number. The Doctor wanted a new dormitory,
but didn’t know how he was going to get it. With
room for say twenty more students the school
would pay very well. As it was, it sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
didn’t pay at all; there were years when the books
balanced the wrong way and the Doctor and his
family stayed at Ferry Hill all through the hot
weather. Harry thought of all this as she led the
way down the hill through the dim grove, and as
a result what conversation ensued was somewhat
spasmodic. At the boat-house Dick busied himself
with his skates and Harry looked on silently;
but finally:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you had any idea of leaving
Hammond, anyway,” she exclaimed aggrievedly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Because—because how could you, if your folks
wanted you to go there—”</p>

<p>“My folks didn’t have much to do with it,” answered
Dick, pulling his gloves on. “There’s only
my dad, anyway. He didn’t know anything about
the schools here and left it to his lawyer in New
York. I said I didn’t much care, and Mr. Warwick
said he’d heard that Hammond was a very
good place, so after Dad sailed I came up here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is your father a sailor?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” laughed Dick, “he’s a mining man.
He owns mines and buys and sells them. My
mother died a couple of years ago and we broke
up housekeeping and went moseying around, Dad
and I. Then when he found he’d have to go to
London and Paris for two or three months he
didn’t know what to do with me. So I said I’d
go to school somewhere in the East; I’d never
been very much, anyway. So that’s how it happened;
savvy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what’s ‘savvy’?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, it means ‘Do you understand?’”</p>

<p>“Then if—if you did want to leave Hammond
you could?” she asked. Dick nodded.</p>

<p>“Sure as shooting! Why not? I told Dad I
wouldn’t stay if I didn’t like it, and he said in
that case I could go back to Helena or join him
in London.”</p>

<p>“My!” exclaimed Harry. “Why don’t you go
to London?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve been there twice,” Dick answered.</p>

<p>“Then—then you—you’ll stay at Hammond?”
asked Harry wistfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Dick. “Maybe.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t like Ferry Hill?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I did,” he answered stoutly. “It
seems a mighty nice school.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t come?”</p>

<p>Dick hesitated, skating about backward and forward
along the edge of the ice and swinging his
arms to keep warm.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he answered finally. “I’ll
think it over. When does school begin?”</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow, but you’d have to get
here to-morrow before six in the evening.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I come—I’ll think about it anyway.
And thanks for showing me around. I’ve had a
real jolly time. Good-night, Miss Emery.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” answered Harry sadly. “I—I
wish you’d decide to come.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I will,” he shouted back as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
skated off. “But if I’m not here by six to-morrow
tell your father not to wait supper for me. Good-night!”
And laughing at his joke Dick Somes
sped off into the darkness across the frozen river.</p>

<p>Harry stood there shivering until she could no
longer hear the ring of his skates. Then she
turned and went disappointedly back up the hill.</p>

<p class="cap">“Well, you old duffer! I thought you were
going to meet me at the station for the
eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I really meant to, Roy,” answered Chub
Eaton, “but my train was nearly an hour late
and I got in just four minutes after you’d gone.
How are you? Did you have a good time Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Bully,” answered Roy Porter. “Did you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, swell! I wish you’d been out with me.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to go,” answered Roy gravely, “but
my folks were afraid I’d get lost in the smoke. I
told them that was hard on Pittsburg, but—”</p>

<p>Roy rolled over backward on Sidney Welch’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bed just in time to avoid the slipper which Chub
hurled.</p>

<p>“But they said they knew the place, Chub,” he
ended.</p>

<p>“You run away and play,” grunted Chub as he
returned to the task of unpacking his trunk.</p>

<p>They were in the Junior Dormitory and up and
down the two sides of the long room was bustle
and excitement and noise. The last train arriving
before six o’clock was in and had brought its load
of students. Trunks and bags were being unpacked,
greetings exchanged and adventures related,
and every one was doing his best to get settled
before dinner-time. Roy, who had arrived on
an earlier train and whose belongings were already
stowed away in his locker in the Senior
Dormitory on the floor above, had met Chub on the
arrival of the coach and had carried one end of the
battered steamer trunk up-stairs. Now he was
reclining comfortably on Sidney’s bed in direct
violation of the dormitory rules, and bothering his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
chum as much as possible. Sid, by the way, a
short, chunky boy of fifteen, was down at the far
end of the hall swapping marvelous tales of vacation
experiences with Chase; his voice, which was
at the changing period, alternately dying away in
gruff whispers and soaring shrilly to a squeaky
falsetto.</p>

<p>“Just listen to Sid,” chuckled Chub as he rolled
a brown sweater up and stuffed it into the locker.
“Sounds as though he were knocking up flies with
his voice, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Roy. “Say, Chub, did I ever
tell you about the man who went to Pittsburg?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dry up,” answered Chub good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“But it’s a true story, honestly, Chub! Of
course the man didn’t go there just for fun; he
had to; it was a matter of life or death, I guess.
Well, when he got back some one asked him if he’d
seen Pittsburg. ‘No,’ says he, ‘but I’ve been
there!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go on,” answered Chub. “Have a good time.
I don’t mind. I’d rather live in Pittsburg where
you can’t see than in New York where you don’t
want to.”</p>

<p>“I guess maybe that’s humor,” said Roy
thoughtfully; “but it’s—er—subtle, Chub, awfully
subtle. Could you give me a hint? Just tell
me what letter the answer begins with!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what letter your name begins
with,” laughed Chub. “And it comes between E
and G.”</p>

<p>“What am I? A musical note?”</p>

<p>“No, a flat!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think you’re sharp!”</p>

<p>Chub Eaton groaned loudly as he slammed the
lid of his trunk down. He was seventeen years of
age, and looked older; was a trifle thick-set, had
brown hair that was almost brick-red, alert brown
eyes, a good-looking, expressive, good-humored
face, and an ease of manner and a self-assurance
which his enemies called conceit and which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
friends loved him for. He was in his last year at
Ferry Hill and consequently in the First Senior
Class. The preceding spring he had succeeded
himself as captain of the base-ball team. While
well-liked by almost every fellow in school, he had
not attained to the popularity which his companion
commanded.</p>

<p>Roy Porter lacked his chum’s air of self-sufficiency
and in looks and manner unconsciously invited
friendship. He was the school leader, and
reigned supreme with none to dispute his title.
Besides that, until the election following Ferry
Hill’s defeat of Hammond on the latter’s gridiron,
a few weeks ago, he had been captain of the foot-ball
team, an honor alone sufficient to turn his
head had that appendage not been very stiffly attached.
Unlike his predecessor in the office of
school leader, one Horace Burlen, who had left
school the previous spring and was now playing
the precarious rôle of freshman in a near-by college,
Roy ruled with a gentle hand and maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
his sway by honest, manly service in behalf of the
school and his fellows. The younger boys worshiped
him, secretly resolved to be Roy Porters
when they grew up, and meanwhile copied his ties
and stockings and cocked their hats as he wore his.</p>

<p>Roy also was a First Senior and would graduate
in June; and like Chub—whose real name, by the
way, was Thomas—was seventeen years old. He
was tall, well-built, athletic, with wavy light-brown
hair, a frank good-looking face and a pair of attractive
gray-blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Say, Chub,” he exclaimed suddenly; “I almost
forgot to tell you. What do you suppose Harry’s
been up to now?”</p>

<p>“Ask me something easier,” begged Chub.</p>

<p>“Swiping students from Hammond!”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Fact! She was down at the station and told
me about it. It’s the funniest thing you ever
heard, Chub!” And Roy laid himself back on the
bed and laughed consumedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Funny’s no word for it,” said Chub soberly.
“I shall die of laughing in a moment.”</p>

<p>“W-wait till I tell you!” gasped Roy.</p>

<p>“I am waiting, you gump! Stop that fuss and
tell me! Don’t keep a fellow waiting all day.”</p>

<p>“Well, listen.” And Roy recounted Harry’s
meeting with Dick Somes, embellishing the tale as
fancy dictated, until Chub too was struggling with
his laughter.</p>

<p>“But—but she didn’t land him after all?”
asked Chub.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t know yet. She told him he’d
have to be here by six o’clock to-night. She pretends
she’s sure he’ll be here, but I guess he was
just fooling her.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Chub. “Wouldn’t it have
been great if he had left Hammond and come here,
eh? Wouldn’t we have had a peachy joke on
them?”</p>

<p>“And wouldn’t they have hated Mr. Dick Summers,
or whatever his name is? But isn’t Harry
the limit?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s plucky, all right,” answered Chub with
a grin. “Fancy having the cheek to try and—”</p>

<p>“Pluck a brand from the burning,” suggested
Roy.</p>

<p>“Exactly! Suppose we run over to the Cottage
and see if he’s shown up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he hasn’t come,” answered Roy, glancing
at his watch. “It’s two minutes of six now.”</p>

<p>“What of it? He might have come half an hour
ago and—” Chub, who was facing the dormitory
door, stopped and stared over Roy’s shoulder.
“Hello!” he ejaculated. Roy turned and followed
his gaze.</p>

<p>Just inside the doorway stood a big, broad-shouldered,
blond-haired youth of apparently sixteen
years of age. He wore a fur cap, a gray
sweater and dark knickerbockers, while in one hand
was a suit case and in the other a pair of skates.
In spite of the fact that the entire hall was observing
him silently and curiously he appeared
not the least bit embarrassed; in fact his self-possession
was then and afterward something to wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
at. After a slow glance about the hall he had
turned his gray eyes on Chub and Roy. There
was a careless, good-humored smile on his singularly
homely and at the same time perplexingly
attractive face.</p>

<p><a href="#image03">“Where do I live, do you suppose?” he asked.</a></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Roy, rising to go to
him. “But I guess you belong on the next floor.
Did the Doctor tell you which dormitory you were
to go to?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen the Doctor,” was the calm reply.
“I just got here. What time is it, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Just six,” answered Roy.</p>

<p>“That’s all right then.” The newcomer set his
bag down and placed his skates on top of it. Then
he threw his fur cap and gloves on to the nearest
bed and started to get out of his sweater.</p>

<p>But Chub, who had said no word so far, but
upon whose countenance a beatific grin had been
growing and spreading with each instant, broke
the silence explosively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42-<br />43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’d you come from?” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Across the river,” answered the other.</p>

<p>“From Hammond?”</p>

<p>“Yep. From Hammond.”</p>

<p>Chub gave a whoop and hurdled the two intervening
beds, landing on top of the suit case, sending
the skates clanging across the floor and violently
grasping the hand of the astounded youth.</p>

<p>“It’s he, Roy!” he yelled delightedly. “It’s
the Brand from the Burning!”</p>

<p>“That’s me,” laughed Dick Somes. “Did she
tell you I was coming?”</p>

<p>“She said she expected you,” answered Roy;
“but—well—”</p>

<p>“We didn’t think you’d have the cheek to do
it,” ended Chub admiringly. “Were they mad?
How did you get away from them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, easy enough. I hadn’t entered, you see.
So I paid them for two days’ board and lodging,
sent my trunk across by sleigh and pulled my suit
case after me. It was quick work,—had to be—but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the only way I could manage it. It scratched
the suit-case up a bit, but that doesn’t matter. I
guess I’d better go and see the boss now and get
my ticket punched.”</p>

<p>“What ticket?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean see the Doctor, take out my
papers, register, put my name down, get enrolled,
whatever you call it,” explained Dick. “Miss
Emery said I’d have to be here by six and I
thought I wasn’t going to make it. I lost my
bearings skating across and headed away down-stream.
That made me late. When do we feed?”</p>

<p>“Right away,” answered Roy. “But you’d
better go over to the Cottage first. Chub and I’ll
show you the way. This is Chub here; his full
name’s Mr. Thomas Eaton. By the way, your
name’s Summers, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Somes,” was the reply. He shook hands
warmly with Chub. “Glad to meet you,” he said.
Then he turned to Roy. “You’re Roy; I’ve
forgotten your last name, but Miss Emery spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
about you. Hope we’ll be friends.” Then he
faced the rest of the fellows who had edged as
close as politeness would allow and who had been
watching the proceedings with unconcealed interest.
“My name’s Dick Somes,” he announced
smilingly, “and I’m glad to meet all you chaps.
We’ll get acquainted later. Now if you’ll lead
the way,” he suggested to Roy, “I’ll get my name
down on the pay-roll.”</p>

<p>“Say, Somes,” said Chub, as they clattered
down-stairs and across the hall, “I don’t usually
welcome strangers in quite such a demonstrative
way, you know, but Roy had just been telling me
about Harry and you, and it seemed such a blamed
good joke that I just had to let out.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Dick laughed. “I’m tickled
to death to find some one with what they call
human emotions. Why, say, you chaps, I’ve been
hibernating over at Hammond for two whole days
with a dozen wooden Indians who wouldn’t even
say ‘Good Morning’ to me until I shouted it! Talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
about your frozen faces! Phew! But you fellows
act as though you had blood in your veins! I
thought maybe I could stand it over there, but
when the push began to drift in this afternoon I
saw that I’d either have to get out or do murder.
They looked me over as though I was some sort of
a dime museum freak until I thought I’d have to
eat glass to please ’em. The first bunch feased
me; I didn’t wait to see what the rest looked like,
but grabbed my pack and hit the trail, and here I
am. All I ask is kind treatment and a comfortable
home.”</p>

<p>“Well, here we are,” laughed Roy. “I hope the
Doctor will let you stay.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he will. I’ve got the money right here
and a bunch of letters that thick. And if he wants
any more references I’ll refer him to Hammond.”</p>

<p>Roy rang the bell and in a moment the door was
thrown open by Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48-<br />49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello, Chub!” she cried. But then her eyes
wandered past him to Dick Somes and her face
lighted up. “Oh, it’s you!” she cried. “Father!
He’s here! It’s Dick Somes!”</p>

<p>“The Brand from the Burning,” murmured
Dick as he followed the others into the little parlor.
Then Harry came dancing back and beckoned
him to the Doctor’s study. The door closed
and Harry returned alone.</p>

<p>“I told you he would come!” she whispered excitedly
to Roy. Roy nodded. Then they sat, the
three of them, like a trio of conspirators and
waited. Once in a while they exchanged smiles,
and Harry and Roy applauded Chub as he read
from a blank sheet of paper, with widely fantastic
gestures, <a href="#image04">an imaginary letter</a> recounting Dick’s
virtues. Then the door opened and the Doctor and
Dick appeared together in the hall.</p>

<p>“Ah, boys,” said the Doctor, “I’m glad to see
you again. You spent a pleasant vacation, I hope.
Now will you kindly take Somes over to Mr. Cobb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and ask him to assign him a bed in the Senior Dormitory?
Thank you. Good evening. I will see
you here in the morning, Somes.”</p>

<p>They left Harry, jubilant, on the porch and returned
through the darkness to Burgess.</p>

<p>“How did it go?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Dick soberly. “Say, the
Doctor’s fine, isn’t he?” The others concurred
and Dick went on:</p>

<p>“He wasn’t going to take me at first; said it
wouldn’t be quite fair to the Hammond folks. But
I told him it was all off between them and me and
that if he wouldn’t take me here I’d go somewhere
else. Then I showed my credentials and he
said finally that if I was in earnest about it and
really wanted to come here to learn and would
abide by the rules and all that he’d take me; and
I said I would and we shook hands. Then he
laughed and said he guessed I’d get on.”</p>

<p>“Good enough,” said Roy. “We’ll find Cobb
and then go down to supper. Are you hungry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hungry! Man, I’m starved! I’ve been living
on apple-sauce for forty-eight hours! Why,
I only have to close my eyes to imagine myself a
Golden Russet!”</p>

<p>“Golden Russet be blowed!” laughed Chub.
“You’re a peach!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE BEGINNING OF A GREAT SCHEME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dick Somes, or “The Brand,” as Chub insisted
on calling him, was a success from
the start. The circumstances attending his arrival
at Ferry Hill enveloped him in a mantle of romance,
while to have thrown over Hammond in
favor of the rival school at once endeared him to
his new friends. Besides this, however, it was
hard to resist his personality. As Chub said one
day in awed tones: “He’s just about as homely as
a mud fence, only somehow you forget all about
it.” And you did. You remembered only that his
look was frank and kindly, his voice wonderfully
pleasant, and his laughter infectious. Before he
had been at Ferry Hill a week he knew every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of his forty-two companions to speak to, and could
call each one by his name without a mistake. The
younger boys tagged after him whenever they
might, and the older ones were frankly eager to be
with him. He could talk interestingly on a hundred
subjects, and could be as breezy as a Kansas
cyclone or as staid and proper as young Cullum,
of the Second Middle, who, on his arrival from
Boston the year before, had been promptly dubbed
“Culture” Cullum.</p>

<p>Born in Ohio, Dick had moved west with his
parents at the age of six years. Then had followed
sojourns in a sod house in Nebraska, in a
log cabin in Montana, in an adobe shack in Colorado,
and in a real carpenter-built house in a Nevada
mining town. After that the fortunes of the
Someses had mended rapidly until, when Dick was
twelve, the family was living comfortably in one
of the finest residences of Helena. For two years
Dick attended school uninterruptedly, something
he had not done before. Then came his mother’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
death and two years of hotel life at home and
abroad for him and his father. So, of course, Dick
had seen a good deal of the world for a boy of his
age, had a keen sense of humor, plenty of imagination,
and could rattle off stories that made his
audience sit with wide eyes and open mouths. Dick
never spoke of wealth, but the impression prevailed
generally that his father was remarkably
well off, and the fact that Dick had his own check-book
and could draw money from a New York
trust company whenever he wanted to naturally
did much to strengthen that impression.</p>

<p>Harry took much credit to herself for Dick’s
capture, and displayed at all times a strong proprietary
interest in him. For his part Dick liked
Harry immensely and endured her tyranny with unfailing
good humor. At Madame Lambert’s School,
in Silver Cove, Harry became quite a heroine, and
the story of how she had induced a Hammond boy
to come to Ferry Hill was in constant demand for
a fortnight after school began again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally enough, Dick’s closest friends were
Chub and Roy—and, of course, Harry; and I
might include Sid Welch. Sid was fifteen and a
confirmed hero-worshiper. Last year he had
transferred his allegiance from Horace Burlen to
Roy, and now appearances indicated that he was
about to transfer it again to Dick. Dick was very
kind to him, as he was to every one, but Sid’s
youthfulness prevented him from any save occasional
companionship with the three older boys.
To be sure, Dick was only sixteen himself, but he
seemed older than either Chub or Roy. He had
barely managed to convince Doctor Emery of his
right to enter the Second Senior class, and was
working very hard to stay there.</p>

<p>One morning, a week or so after the beginning
of the new term, Dick, Roy, Chub, and Harry were
seated, the two former on the grain chest and the
two latter on an empty box, in the barn. The big
doors were wide open and the morning sunlight
fell across the dusty floor in a long path of gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
The cold had moderated and that day the water
was dripping from the eaves, and the snow was
sliding with sudden excited rustlings from the
roofs of the barn and sheds. Beyond the sunlight
the floor faded into the twilight of the building
wherein the forms of farm wagons and machinery
were dimly discerned. From close at hand, to be
exact, from tiers of boxes and home-made cages
ranged along one side of the barn, came strange
sounds; squeaks, soft murmurs, little rustling
noises, excited chatters, and now and then a plaintive
me-ow. The sounds came from the inhabitants
of Harry’s menagerie, as Roy had nicknamed
the collection of pets. Overhead was the soft cooing
of pigeons, and outside in the warm sunlight
many of them were wheeling through the air and
strutting about the yard. Dick had just been formally
introduced to the inhabitants of the boxes;
to Lady Grey and her two furry, purry kittens, to
Angel and others of his family—white, pink-eyed
rabbits these—, to Teety, the squirrel, to Pete and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Repeat and Threepete, black rabbits all, to Snip,
the fox terrier, to numerous excitable white mice,
and, last but not least, to Methuselah.</p>

<p>Methuselah was the parrot, a preternaturally
solemn and dignified bird as long as he refrained
from conversation. When he spoke he betrayed
himself as the jeering old fraud that he was. Just
at present he was seated on Harry’s arm, his head
on one side, and one glittering eye closed. Closing
one eye gave him a very wise look, and I fancy he
knew it. At Harry’s feet lay Snip, stretched out
in the sunshine, and at a little distance Spot, an
Angora cat and the black sheep of the family, sat
hunched into a round ball of furriness and
watched proceedings with pessimistic gaze.</p>

<p>“When does the first hockey game come, Roy?”
asked Chub.</p>

<p>“A week from Saturday, with Cedar Grove. By
the way, Dick, can you play hockey?”</p>

<p>“No, what’s it like?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever seen a game?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t think so. It’s a sort of shinny on the
ice, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Something like that,” answered Roy. “You
ought to learn. Harry says you’re a dandy
skater, and that’s half the battle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I never could play games,” said Dick.
“I’ve tried to catch a base-ball, but I never could
do it.”</p>

<p>“You come out for practice in a month or so,”
said Chub, “and I’ll bet you can learn how. Will
you?”</p>

<p>“If you like. Do both you fellows play?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Roy plays first base and I play second.”</p>

<p>“Chub is captain,” added Harry.</p>

<p>“And where do you play?” asked Dick, turning
to her.</p>

<p>“They won’t let me play,” answered Harry disgustedly.
“I can play just as well as Sid Welch,
though!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, Harry,” laughed Chub, “Sid
played a pretty good game last year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“So could I if you’d let me. I can catch any ball
you can throw, Chub Eaton, and you know it!”</p>

<p>“Of course you can,” said Chub soothingly.
“I’ll put you behind the bat this year, Harry.”</p>

<p>“How far behind?” asked Roy. “Back of the
fence?” Harry made a face at him.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t think of playing if you bar Harry
out,” said Dick gravely. “Harry rescued me from
a life of idleness at Hammond, and brought me
over here where I’m buzzing my brain out trying
to keep up with my class, and I’m naturally awfully
grateful to her. If you don’t let her play
you can’t have my invaluable services, Chub.”</p>

<p>“Look here, how about foot-ball?” demanded
Roy.</p>

<p>“Me?” asked Dick. “I don’t know the first
thing about it. The only game I can play is
chess.”</p>

<p>“But you ought to do something with those
muscles of yours,” insisted Roy. “Did you ever
do any rowing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never even saw a race,” was the cheerful
reply. “Oh, I’m no athlete, me. The only thing
I can do is ride and fish and shoot and throw a
rope and—and run a little.”</p>

<p>“Run?”</p>

<p>“Yes, on my feet, you know. Don’t you ever
run hereabout?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Chub, “we run bases.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do that, I guess; a mile’s about my
measure. Don’t you have foot races here?”</p>

<p>“No, we don’t do anything in that line. Hammond
has a track team, but we haven’t. You
should have stayed where you were put, if you
want to be a runner.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with getting up one of
those things here?” asked Dick. “One of those
track teams? You’ve got a track, haven’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s not much good. We only use it
for exercise,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t it be fixed up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe the Doctor would do it,” answered
Roy. “You see, it would cost a lot, and
I know there isn’t much money to spend.”</p>

<p>“Why? Doesn’t the school make money?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but not very much; does it, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes it doesn’t make anything; it
loses,” replied Harry cheerfully. “Then I wear
my old dresses in the summer, and we stay here at
Ferry Hill; only sometimes I have to go and visit
Aunt Harriet Beverly, which is much worse than
staying at home.”</p>

<p>“Must be a leak somewhere,” said Dick. “Why,
with forty-three boys at four hundred dollars a
year, I don’t see why the Doctor doesn’t make
slathers of coin.”</p>

<p>“He used to,” said Harry; “but everything
costs so much more nowadays, you see. Papa says
that if we had accommodations for twenty more
boys the school would make money.”</p>

<p>“What kind of accommodations?” asked Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, places to sleep and eat,” answered
Harry.</p>

<p>“But if he’s losing money now with forty boys
I should think he’d lose half as much again with
sixty,” said Chub.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you ever hear the saying that it costs
as much to feed three persons as it does two?”
laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“Papa means,” explained Harry, “that the expenses
wouldn’t be much larger than they are
now. It would take more food, of course, and—and
things like that, but there wouldn’t have to be
any more teachers, because papa and Mr. Cobb
and Mr. Buckman could teach sixty boys just as
well as forty.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Chub. “But—could he get twenty
more boys? The school isn’t quite full now, you
know.”</p>

<p>“He could if he advertised in the magazines and
papers,” said Harry. “He never has advertised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
because he says it wouldn’t pay to do it unless he
could take lots more boys.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like the school as it is,” said Chub. “I
think there is just enough of a crowd here now.
If it was much bigger we wouldn’t hang together
the way we do and we wouldn’t have half so good
a time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’d like the Doctor to make something,”
said Roy. “I’d like Harry to have new
dresses in the summer and not have to visit her
Aunt Harriet,” he continued with a laugh. “Besides,
if the school was making plenty of money
we could have a new boat-house, and an addition
to the grand stand and things like that, probably.”</p>

<p>“And a new running track,” added Dick. “I’m
in favor of enlarging the school!”</p>

<p>“Objection withdrawn,” said Chub. “Go ahead
and do it.”</p>

<p>“Then, too,” said Roy, who had apparently
been considering the matter quite seriously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
“we’d have a larger number of fellows to pick our
teams from. If we’ve been able to win from Hammond
in most everything in the long run with only
half as many fellows as she has, what could we do
to her if we had three fourths as many?”</p>

<p>“Third class in algebra!” murmured Chub.
“Mr. Somes may answer.”</p>

<p>“Not prepared,” said Dick promptly.</p>

<p>“But it’s so,” cried Harry. “Why, we could—we
could simply lambaste them!”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Harry!” laughed Chub.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is so,” pursued Roy earnestly.</p>

<p>“That’s why Hammond can have a track team
and we can’t. She has nearly ninety fellows this
year to our forty-three. That means that she’s
got two chances to our one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle!” scoffed Chub. “Why doesn’t she
lick us then? We’ve beaten her three times out
of four at foot-ball, and we’re away ahead in
base-ball victories, and in rowing. No, sir, the
reason we’ve been able to lick her is just because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
we have so few fellows that we all stick together
and work for the school, and when we get a lot
more here it will be different and there’ll be
cliques and things like that, and half the school
won’t speak to the other half.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t so at Hammond, I guess,” objected
Dick. “From what little I learned of the place
the fellows stick together pretty well.”</p>

<p>“Besides, twenty more wouldn’t make much
difference,” added Roy. “What you say might be
so if we had two or three hundred, like some of the
big schools; but not with sixty. I cast my vote
with Dick; let’s enlarge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” cried Harry, “let’s! How’ll
we do it?”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let me interfere,” said Chub good-naturedly.
“I’ll just sit here and keep still while
you do it. But don’t be long, because I’ve got a
lesson in just ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s only one way to do it,” said Dick
promptly. “We must have a new dormitory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, is that it?” asked Chub. “I’ll see if I
can find one for you.” He began to peer around
on the floor. “I suppose one slightly used
wouldn’t do?”</p>

<p>“You dry up and blow away,” said Roy.
“We’re talking business.”</p>

<p>“And if you want to come in on the ground
floor,” said Dick, “now’s your chance. If you
wait you’ll have to pay a big price to join the
Society.”</p>

<p>“What’s it called? The Society of Hopeless
Idiots?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; it’s called the Ferry Hill Improvement
Society,” replied Dick. “And its objects
are to obtain a new dormitory, increased attendance,
a new running track and a track team.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?” jeered Chub. “It sounds so easy
I guess I’ll have to come in. You may put me
down for president.”</p>

<p>“We’ll put you down for janitor, that’s what
we’ll put you down for,” said Roy scathingly.
“Dick shall be president.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“I decline,” said Dick. “I nominate Miss
Harry Emery, Esquire.”</p>

<p>“No, Roy must be president,” answered Harry,
“and I’ll be secretary and treasurer, because I
have more time than you fellows. And Dick must
be vice-president, and Chub—”</p>

<p>“I’ll be referee.”</p>

<p>“No, you’ll be second vice-president.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Chub cheerfully.
“That’s me. I’m the one who attends banquets
and does the jollying. You folks do the work.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Roy soberly. “Are you fellows
in fun or do you—do you really intend to go
into this?”</p>

<p>Chub grinned and Harry looked doubtful. Dick,
however, answered promptly.</p>

<p>“No, sir, there’s no fun about it!” he declared.
“We’re going to do it. Work on the new dormitory
begins as soon as school closes in June. Why
not? What’s a dormitory, anyhow? Thirty thousand
will build it, I guess; and if we can’t scrape
up that much before June we don’t deserve it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll bet you anything he believes it!” said
Chub in awed tones.</p>

<p>“Of course I believe it,” said Dick stoutly.
“We’ll send letters to the graduates asking for
subscriptions, and we’ll get the fellows in school
interested and make them contribute. I’ll start
the ball rolling myself with fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Chub. “I can’t give much more
than fifty cents, I guess.”</p>

<p>“You’ll give five dollars, anyhow,” declared
Dick. “No subscriptions received for less than
five.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give five!” cried Harry eagerly. “I’ve
got almost that much in my bank.”</p>

<p>“Good! Fifty and fifteen are—”</p>

<p>“Is,” corrected Chub.</p>

<p>“<em>Am</em>—sixty-five,” said Dick. “That’s a good
starter.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” laughed Roy. “We only need twenty-nine
thousand nine hundred and thirty-five
more!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, maybe it won’t take thirty thousand,” said
Dick cheerfully. “I only guessed at it. We’ll
find out about that the first thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no harm in trying,” said Roy.
“And it’ll be good fun whether anything comes
of it or not. But I vote that Chub be made president
because I’m going to be too busy during the
next two months to attend properly to the duties
of the office. You see, hockey doesn’t leave much
time for other things.”</p>

<p>“Not me, though,” Chub protested. “I never
was president of anything, and don’t know what
you do. Besides, I’m going to be pretty busy myself
in another six weeks. Base-ball candidates
are coming out early this year. Dick’s the man
for president; he started the trouble and the subscriptions.
All in favor—”</p>

<p>“I’d just as lief serve as president,” said Dick,
“only I may be busy myself pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“What at?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“Forming that track team. I’m going to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
captain of it, you know. Roy’s captain of the
hockey team and you’re captain of the nine, and
I’ve got to be captain of something, myself.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean that you’re going to try
and get up a team?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I want you fellows to help me. Will
you?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” cried Chub. “It’s a good scheme,
Dick. I’ll wager there are lots of fellows here
who will be pleased purple to join.”</p>

<p>“Will <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“Me? Why, I can’t do anything.”</p>

<p>“How do you know? I dare say you can run bases,
and if you can do that maybe you can sprint. And
Roy ought to make a good distance runner. You
say he was in the Cross Country last fall.”</p>

<p>“I’ll join,” said Roy. “I don’t suppose I can
do anything, but I’m willing to try.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Chub. “And while we’re
about it, let’s start a few other things. We
haven’t got a croquet club, nor a sewing circle,
you know.”</p>

<p>“And if we started those, Harry could join,”
laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“I should think you might let me join the track
team,” said Harry. “I can run as fast as anything,
Dick!”</p>

<p>“As secretary of the F. H. I. S.,” replied Dick,
“you will have no time for trivial affairs, Harry.
You’ve let yourself in for a lot of hard work, if
you only knew it. Now, I propose—”</p>

<p>“I propose,” exclaimed Chub, jumping up,
“that I go to my recitation. When’s the next
meeting?”</p>

<p>“The secretary will issue a call for it,” answered
Dick.</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” suggested Roy, “that the name
ought to be the Ferry Hill <em>School</em> Improvement
Society; people might think we were trying to improve
the Hill.”</p>

<p>“Settle it to suit yourselves,” cried Chub, making
a dash for the door. “I’m off.”</p>

<p>Methuselah, who had been dozing for some time,
awoke startled, and broke into angry remonstrances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
“Well, I never did!” he screeched
hoarsely. “Can’t you be quiet? Stop your swearing!
Stop your swearing! Stop your swearing!”</p>

<p>And the first <a href="#image05">meeting of the</a> small but very
select <a href="#image05">Ferry Hill School Improvement Society</a>
broke up in confusion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE F. H. S. I. S. HOLDS A MEETING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A few days later Harry sat at the little desk
in her room, her feet twined around the legs
of her chair, her head very much on one side and
a pen in her hand. Before her, on the pink blotting-pad,
were four postal cards. Two were already
written on, and a third was under way:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ferry Hill, N. Y.</span>, January 14.</p>

<p>There will be a meeting of the F. H. S. I. S. at the
rooms of the Society (this means the barn), at 4 o’clock on
the afternoon of January 16th. As the object of the meeting
is to perfect a permanent organization, a full attendance
is desired.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr9">Respectfully,</span><br />
<span class="padr5 smcap">H. Emery,</span><br />
<span class="right">Sec’y and Treas.</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Harry laid down her pen with a sigh of relief,
and wiped some of the ink from her fingers by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
rubbing them on the edge of the blotter. Then,
getting a new grip on the chair legs with her feet,
she took up the last postal. At that moment
Mrs. Emery passed the open door, smiled and
entered.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, pet?” she asked, laying
a hand on Harry’s shoulder, and glancing at the
postals.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Harry gave a start and looked up in
surprise. <a href="#image06">“Mama, you mustn’t see!” she cried.
“It’s a secret!”</a></p>

<p>“A secret? Well, my dear, I wouldn’t write it
on postals then,” laughed her mother. “Don’t
you know that any one can read it that way?”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t a secret—exactly,” explained
Harry. “But it’s something you and papa
mustn’t know about, yet. Are you reading it?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve stopped, dear. But what is the F. H.
S. I. S?”</p>

<p>“That’s it! That’s the secret. It’s a society.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<a id="image06">
  <img src="images/image06.jpg" width="411" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_76">“‘Mama, you mustn’t see!’ she cried. ‘It’s a secret!’”</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78-<br />79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you think, pet, that you are a little too
young to belong to secret societies?” asked Mrs.
Emery smilingly.</p>

<p>“Not this kind, mama; this is—is a benevolent
society.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s for a worthy purpose.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? And what is the purpose, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s to—now, there, mama, you almost
made me tell you!” Harry turned and pushed
her mother away. “I’m not going to answer any
more questions!” She set her lips tightly and
determinedly together.</p>

<p>“But, Harry,” said her mother teasingly, “you
know you never can keep a secret! You needn’t
even try. You might as well tell me now as later.”</p>

<p>Harry shook her head violently, but refused to
speak.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Mrs. Emery sadly, “if
you can’t trust me, Harry, I suppose—”</p>

<p>Harry was not proof against this. She jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
up and threw her arms about Mrs. Emery’s comfortable
waist, and hugged tight.</p>

<p>“It isn’t fair!” she cried. “You’re trying to
work on my feelings, mama, and make me feel
naughty; and then I’ll have to tell you! And
it isn’t my secret, dearest, not mine alone, and it
wouldn’t be fair to Roy and Chub and Dick if I
told you. And after a while you’ll know all about
it, if you’ll only wait, and you and papa are to
pick out the site for the dormitory and—”</p>

<p>“Dormitory? What are you talking about,
child?”</p>

<p>But Harry had clasped both hands to her mouth
and was looking so distressed that her mother
took pity on her. “Very well, my dear, I won’t
ask you any more questions. But don’t get into
mischief.” She kissed Harry and retired smiling.
Harry returned to the desk with a loud sigh of
relief and seated herself for the completion of her
task.</p>

<p>“It was the nearest thing!” she thought. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
almost told it right out! But just the same I
think it was unkind of mama to say I couldn’t
keep a secret!”</p>

<p>When the last card was written she addressed
them; one to Roy, one to Chub, one to Dick, and
one to herself.</p>

<p>“It’s more businesslike,” she declared silently.
“Secretaries of societies are such busy folks that
I guess they are very likely to forget engagements
unless they have notices around where they can
see them.”</p>

<p>She was forced to own, however, that it wasn’t
necessary to post her notice with the others the
following morning at Silver Cove. But then, for
that matter, it wasn’t absolutely necessary to
post any of them! She could just as well have
handed them to the addressees; but sending them
through the mail made them seem far more important,
and the whole thing more real.</p>

<p>The second formal meeting of the Society therefore
came off on the following Wednesday afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
but without the desired full attendance. For
Roy was very busy on the rink where the hockey
team was getting ready for the game with Cedar
Grove School three day later. It was decidedly
chilly in the “rooms of the Society” this afternoon,
and the members did not remove their
wraps. A portion of the menagerie made the mistake
of supposing that feeding-time had arrived,
and it was some minutes before order was restored.
Methuselah had such a lot to say that
Harry was forced to drop the canvas in front of
his cage, whereupon, after much disgusted muttering,
he concluded that it was really bed-time
and that he would go to sleep.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Harry apologetically, “that
I ought to read the minutes of the last meeting;
only there aren’t any.”</p>

<p>“In which case,” said Chub, “I move you, Mr.
President, and fellow-members, that the reading
of the minutes be dispensed with.”</p>

<p>“I move so, too,” said Harry excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean you second the motion,” Chub corrected.
“Question, Mr. President!”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll worry along without parliamentary
procedure,” laughed Dick. “And I don’t believe
it will be necessary yet awhile to keep the
minutes. Here’s the subscription list. I’ve put
my name down for fifty dollars. You two sign,
and get Roy to. Then you had better keep it,
Harry. Now, are we going to take in more members
or keep this thing to ourselves? I’m in favor
of having just us four, because if we have a lot it
will be hard to get anything done; the fellows will
always be wanting to speak and ask questions and
all that. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Four’s enough,” said Chub. And Harry nodded
concurrence.</p>

<p>“All right. Now I’ve been asking questions,
and I’ve found that Burgess Hall cost twenty-seven
thousand dollars. But it was built twelve
years ago, and Mr. Cobb says labor and materials
have almost doubled in cost since then. If that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
so Burgess would cost about forty-five thousand
to-day; but the new dormitory wouldn’t have to
be more than half as large because it would have
to accommodate only twenty fellows, and wouldn’t
have to have a dining-room. But I think it ought
to be built in such a way that it could be added to
later. I’ve been figuring for a while on the thing,
and I think we’ll need just about what I said the
other day, thirty thousand.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s have enough while we’re about
it,” said Chub dryly. “Maybe we’d better say
forty thousand.”</p>

<p>“So now the thing to do,” continued Dick, “is
to write a letter saying what we’re trying to do,
and asking for subscriptions. We’ll have it
printed and send it around to the grads. I guess
we can get hold of their names all right, for the
Doctor must have a list of them somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has,” said Harry. “There’s a big
book of names and addresses in the office.”</p>

<p>“But it’ll cost something for printing and
postage, won’t it?” asked Chub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and so we’ve got to have some ready
money. I guess twenty-five dollars will be enough
for the present.”</p>

<p>“Well, but where is it coming from?”</p>

<p>“From the subscriptions. The treasurer must
collect from us. I’ll pay ten dollars now, and you
fellows can give something, too. Then I’ll give
Harry a check for the rest of what I owe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll have something to treasure, won’t I?”
cried Harry. “That’s what a treasurer’s for,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Dick brought out his purse and selected
two five-dollar bills from the little roll of money it
contained, and handed them to Harry, who accepted
them with shining eyes. “You must send
me a receipt for it, you know,” said Dick. Chub
fished ruefully around in his trousers pocket and
finally produced a dollar and twenty cents.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll keep the change,” he said, “but
you can have the dollar. Gee! I can just see that
dormitory, Dick!”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Dick good-humoredly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
“you go ahead and have your fun. How many
fellows do you suppose have gone to school here?”</p>

<p>“Fury, I don’t know!” said Chub. “A whole
bunch of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, how many usually enter in the fall?”</p>

<p>“This year there were fourteen new boys—counting
you,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“We’ll call it twelve,—just a dozen,” said Dick.
“How long has the school been running?”</p>

<p>“About thirty years, I think. Papa has had it
twelve years, and I think it was almost twenty
years old then.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Dick; “thirty times twelve is
three hundred and sixty. Some of them are either
dead or have moved, nobody knows where, I dare
say, so we’ll call it three hundred. If each one
gave five dollars it would be—let me see—”</p>

<p>“Fifteen hundred,” said Harry, proudly.</p>

<p>“What! Nonsense! It must be more than
that!”</p>

<p>“Yep. Fifteen hundred,” said Chub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“But that can’t be right!” exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>“It is, though,” Chub said with a smile. Dick
looked thunder-struck.</p>

<p>“Fifteen hundred! Why, that won’t do any
good! How much would each grad have to give
to make thirty thousand?”</p>

<p>“One hundred dollars,” answered Harry
promptly.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a lot,” said Dick thoughtfully;
“because some of them probably can’t afford that
much.”</p>

<p>“Maybe some of them will give more,” suggested
Chub.</p>

<p>“That’s so; some might give a thousand. If
only ten of them would do that then the others
would have to give only seventy-five, or—well,
something like that.”</p>

<p>“I guess if we get ten dollars apiece out of them
on the average we’ll be doing well,” said Chub
pessimistically.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to put it to them so that they’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
want to give a lot,” said Dick. “We’ve got to
get together and work up a letter that’ll make ’em
weep! Roy ought to help with that, and so I suggest
we put that over until the next meeting.
Meanwhile let’s each get up what he thinks would
be about right and we’ll compare the—the appeals
and work them together next time. Then we’ll
have it printed.”</p>

<p>“Before that, though,” said Chub, “we ought
to talk it over with the Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll do that when we have the appeal
written out,” answered Dick. “And we’ll get
him to let us have the names and addresses of the
grads. And after we’ve posted the letters we’ll
get up a subscription list and circulate it through
the school. I’ve figured that we ought to get two
hundred and seventy dollars that way, without
anything from the Doctor, and I dare say he’d
like to give something.”</p>

<p>“Of course he would,” said Harry. “Maybe
he’d give—a hundred! You see, we wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
want to go away this summer, anyhow, if the dormitory
was being built.”</p>

<p>“I guess you won’t have to stay at home on that
account,” murmured Chub.</p>

<p>“I think you’re horrid,” said Harry. “You’re
making fun of it all the time. If you don’t think
it can be done, I don’t see why you don’t leave the
Society.”</p>

<p>“Because,” laughed Chub, “I never belonged
to a society before, and I like it immensely. I don’t
say we won’t succeed, but I don’t believe we’ll
ever get the money by writing some letters to the
graduates; that is, not by just that alone.”</p>

<p>“What’s your idea?” asked Dick eagerly.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to get some one to give a big
sum, say five or ten thousand, as a starter. Then
we could find out which of the old boys are well
off, and put it up to them; tell them So-and-So had
given ten thousand dollars and ask them to go
and do likewise. Of course, every grad ought to
be allowed the privilege of contributing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
worthy cause, but there’s no use expecting to get
much that way. And when the letters or circulars
are sent out, a subscription blank ought to go
along.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good scheme,” said Dick thoughtfully.
“How can we find out who the wealthy
grads are?”</p>

<p>“I dare say the Doctor knows,” said Chub.
“Anyhow, we can ask him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and don’t you think his name ought to go
on the letter? Wouldn’t it look more—more
official?”</p>

<p>“I guess it would,” answered Chub. “I believe
we ought to elect him honorary something; isn’t
that what’s usually done?”</p>

<p>“Honorary President,” suggested Dick.</p>

<p>“That’s lovely!” cried Harry. “He’ll be so
pleased!”</p>

<p>“He’s elected then,” said Dick, and Chub nodded.</p>

<p>“Then I say we adjourn the meeting and get together
again as soon as we can when Roy can attend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
The trouble is that he has hockey every
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Except Monday.”</p>

<p>“All right then; Monday it is. That’s five
days from now, and we’ll have time to think up
the letter to the grads. It’s settled then,” added
Dick, as he slid off the grain chest. “Now let’s
go and watch Roy practice hockey awhile.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t forget, Chub,” said Harry, “that
you owe four dollars to the treasury. And I must
collect from Roy, mustn’t I? Do you think I’d
better open an account at the Silver Cove bank,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess you won’t have it long enough,”
he laughed.</p>

<p>“But it’ll be a good deal of money to keep in
the house,” Harry objected. “Suppose some one
stole it?”</p>

<p>“Then you’d have to make good,” said Chub.
“By the way, Dick, isn’t it customary to put the
treasurer under bond?”</p>

<p>“I believe so. Can you give bond, Harry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what that is,” answered Harry;
“but I know I’m going to keep this money where
no one can find it! You know a thief broke into
the house three summers ago when we were away,
and stole papa’s winter overcoat and a lot of silverware,
and they never got him!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” laughed Dick. “Don’t you
take any risks with that immense sum you have
there, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a good deal when Chub and Roy
pay,” said Harry gravely, as they left the barn
and started along the road toward the dormitory.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll settle with you Saturday,” said
Chub. “I’m dead-broke now; there’s only twenty
cents between me and the cold world.”</p>

<p>“And it <em>is</em> a cold world, too,” muttered Dick,
pulling his sweater up around his chin. “I don’t
believe I want to stand in the snow and watch
those hockey players very long.”</p>

<p>“Just a little while,” pleaded Chub. “It’s lots
of fun to see Harris fall down; he can fall farther
and harder than any fellow I ever saw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to play this year, Chub?”
asked Harry.</p>

<p>“No, Glidden’s a heap better than I am, and,
besides, I’ll be busy at base-ball before the hockey
schedule’s finished; so I thought I might as well
drop out of it.”</p>

<p>“Wait for me a minute,” said Harry when they
reached the Cottage. “I’ll put this money away
in the house.”</p>

<p>They waited for her and then the three went
down the hill to the river, and along the bank to
the rink where Roy and Kirby and Warren and
Harris and a dozen others were charging madly
about the ice in the teeth of a freezing gale.</p>

<small>ON THE ICE AND THROUGH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When the thermometer on the north side
of School Hall registers four degrees below
zero at noon it means cold weather; and that
is just what the thermometer did on Saturday. In
sheltered angles where the sun shone it was not so
bad, but on the way across the campus, where the
wind blew unobstructed, fellows in knickerbockers
moved rapidly, Jack Frost in pursuit and pinching
their calves sharply. By half past three, what
time the hockey game with Cedar Grove School
was scheduled to commence, the mercury had
dropped another point and the audience about the
rink consisted of exactly six boys, among them
Dick and Sid Welch, and one girl. Of course the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
girl was Harry. I doubt if there was another girl
for miles up or down the river who would have
braved the cold that afternoon for the sake of
sport and patriotism.</p>

<p>The rink is some three hundred yards down the
shore from the boat-house. Years before a ferry
plied between this point and the opposite town of
Coleville, but with the completion of the new
bridge below Silver Cove the enterprise, like many
similar ones in the vicinity, had ceased to be
profitable. Ultimately the boat had disappeared
and only the ferry house and landing remained.
But that was last year; now even those were gone,
the lumber—such of it as was fit for the purpose—having
been used in the construction of the barrier
around the rink. Many of the old joists and
planks, however, were too rotten to hold nails and
these had been left piled up on the beach. Sid,
struck by a brilliant idea, had looted the pile, and
by the time the game had begun a big bonfire was
blazing merrily. The handful of spectators divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
their attention between the fire and the contest
until the first half was over, with the score
three goals for Ferry Hill and one for Cedar
Grove. Then every one, players, spectators, substitutes,
and referee—who was Chub—gathered as
near the flames as safety permitted and alternately
turned faces and backs to the warmth.</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder, Sid,” declared Roy. “If I
had half your brain—!” He shook his head eloquently,
at a loss for words.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sid’s a great fellow for scheming how to
be comfortable,” said Billy Warren, who played
right center for Ferry Hill. “Did you ever hear
about the contrivance he rigged up on his bed the
first year he was here?”</p>

<p>Every one replied that he had, except Harry;
and Harry demanded to be told.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Warren, “Sid used to go to sleep
with two blankets over him and the comforter
over the foot of the bed, you know. Then along
toward morning it would get cold and Sid would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
want the comforter, but he was too sleepy to reach
down and get it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” interrupted Chub, whose bed
was next to Sid’s in the Junior Dormitory. “I
used to find him all curled up in a ball in the
morning with his teeth chattering like—like—”</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” declared Sid.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Sid, you know you did,” said Warren.
“Well, so what does Sid do but get a piece
of clothes-line and tie an end to each corner of the
comforter. Then when he woke up and found he
was freezing to death all he had to do was to take
hold of the rope and pull the comforter up. Oh,
he’s a wonder, Sid is!”</p>

<p>“Just the same, it worked all right,” said Sid
with a grin, as the laugh went around. “And I
wish I had that comforter now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you could get much more on,”
said Dick, as he viewed Sid’s rotund appearance.
“You look like a bale of sweaters now.”</p>

<p>“I’ve only got two on,” was the reply. “I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
going to borrow Chub’s, but he went and wore it
himself.”</p>

<p>“How dare you, Chub?” laughed Roy. “You
ought to have more consideration for others.”</p>

<p>“Thunder!” replied Chub good-naturedly, “Sid
would borrow everything I have if I’d let him.
As it is he wears more of my things than his own.
Last week I tried to find a pair of stockings and
couldn’t; Sid had the whole lot in his locker.”</p>

<p>“They had holes in them,” answered Sid
gravely.</p>

<p>“They certainly had when you got through
with them,” laughed Chub. “Come on, fellows;
time’s up.”</p>

<p>The two teams went back to the ice, peeling off
sweaters and gloves, and presently the game was
on again. It was the first contest of the year and
the play was pretty ragged. But there were exciting
moments, as when Harris, who played point
on the home team, got away with the puck for a
long race down the rink, passed to Fernald in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
front of the Cedar Grove goal, captured the disk
again on the quick return and smashed it past
goal-tender’s knees for a score. Toward the latter
part of the period the visitors weakened and Ferry
Hill’s tally grew rapidly, until at the final call of
time the score stood 12-4 in favor of the home
players. Cheers were exchanged and the Cedar
Grove fellows hurried away toward the station.
The others went back to the replenished fire and
leisurely donned their sweaters. Dick, who had
a moment before wandered away toward the edge
of the river, called to Roy.</p>

<p>“What’s that thing over there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What thing? Where?”</p>

<p>“Across the river. It looks like a boat, but I
don’t see how any one can sail a boat when there
isn’t any water.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” answered Roy, joining him, “that’s an
ice-boat, you silly galoot. Haven’t you ever seen
one before?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ve seen pictures of them. I didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
recognize it, though. Say, that’s pretty slick, isn’t
it? Look at the way it scoots around over
there! How the dickens is it made?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you make a frame-work of timbers kind
of three-cornered like and stick a skate or a runner
at each corner, and put a mast in with a sail
or two, and have another runner at the back with
a tiller for steering, and there you are.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say? Well, that’s the most—er—enlightening
explanation I ever heard, Roy;
lucid’s no name for it!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the best I can do,” Roy laughed.
“If you want further particulars I advise you
to run over and take a look. I’m no boat-builder.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ll do,” answered Dick, tightening
the straps of his skates. “Come along!”</p>

<p>“Are you crazy? Want me to freeze myself?”</p>

<p>“Freeze nothing! It’ll warm you up. Come
on; it won’t take but a minute or two.” Roy
hesitated. Then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” he consented, “I’ll go you. Only
it isn’t likely that the boat’s going to stay there
and wait for us.”</p>

<p>“Bet you I can catch her if she doesn’t have
too big a start,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure!” scoffed Roy. “She only makes
about thirty miles an hour!”</p>

<p>“Get out!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, though,” answered Roy. “They
say some of them can do pretty near a mile a
minute in a good wind. I don’t know about that
one there, though; don’t think I ever saw her before;
she’s got a red hull, hasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you call that thing a hull,” replied
Dick. “Are there any more around here?”</p>

<p>“Two or three, I think.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, maybe I’ll let this one go if it tries
to get away,” Dick said. “Are you ready?”</p>

<p>Roy said that he was, but at that moment Chub
hailed them.</p>

<p>“Where you fellows going?” he shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Across the river,” answered Roy. “Dick
wants to study ice-boats. Want to come?”</p>

<p>Chub and Harry and Sid joined them, the latter
begging them to wait until he could get his
skates on.</p>

<p>“All right, slow poke,” answered Roy. “How
about you, Harry? It’ll be beastly cold out in the
middle there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m nice and warm,” answered Harry.
“What did you say about an ice-boat?”</p>

<p>“Dick never saw one before and he wants to
go over and make the acquaintance of that one
over there. Whose is it, Harry? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it belongs to Joe Thurston, Grace Thurston’s
brother. He goes to Hammond. She’s in
my class at Madame Lambert’s.”</p>

<p>“Who, the ice-boat?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“No, Mister Smarty, Grace Thurston. Anyhow,
I said ‘it.’”</p>

<p>“You said ‘she!’”</p>

<p>“I said ‘it!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ladies! Ladies!” remonstrated Roy. “No
disturbance, I beg of you! Remember there’s a
gentleman present.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Chub, looking carefully
around.</p>

<p>“Here,” grunted Sid, tugging at a strap.</p>

<p>“For that lie, Sid,” answered Chub severely,
“we will go and leave you. Come on, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait please!” begged Sid. “I can’t get
the buckle in the right hole. My fingers are frozen
stiff. You might help a chap, Chub.”</p>

<p>“All right, I will if you’ll tell the truth. Are
you a gentleman, Sid?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Sid diplomatically. “It’s that
fourth hole, Chub. That’s it. Thanks.” He got
up, hobbled to the edge of the ice and skated away.
“Neither are you, Chub!” he shouted tauntingly.
Chub instantly gave chase, leaving the other three
to follow more leisurely. Across the frozen river
and a little further down-stream the ice-boat was
skimming up and down near shore, luffing, filling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and turning in the brisk wind as though trying her
sails.</p>

<p>“That’s just about what she’s doing, I guess,”
said Roy as they skated, three abreast, a hundred
yards or so behind the flying forms of Sid and
Chub. “Those sails are brand-new, I think. She’s
coming around again. If we were nearer now
you could get a good view of her, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try, anyhow,” answered Dick,
as he dug his blades in the black ice and sped
away from them.</p>

<p>“Shall we try it, too?” asked Roy. Harry
nodded her head.</p>

<p>“I’ll race you,” she cried, and, suiting action
to word, darted off after Dick. She had obtained
a good lead before Roy had gathered his wits together,
and he realized that to attempt to overtake
that flying form was quite useless for him. He
was a good skater, but Harry had held the school
supremacy for several years and had, as she had
stated to Dick, even beaten Hammond’s best talent
the winter before. But Harry had found more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
than her match at last, for, try as she could and
did, she could not gain an inch on Dick, who was
putting in his best licks in an endeavor to head off
the ice-boat as it passed up-stream close to the
farther shore. In a trice Roy was left to himself.
He saw that he could not hope to intercept the
boat even if the others did, and so kept on diagonally
across the river toward the ice-houses below
Coleville. Sid and Chub were still busy with their
own affairs, the former leading the latter a difficult
chase, turning and doubling and thus far avoiding
capture. The wind swept across the ice with stinging
buffets against legs and face, and Roy rubbed
his ears vigorously to keep them from freezing.
Presently he drew near where they had been cutting
ice and found that to continue on toward the
shore and the path of the returning boat he would
either have to cross the cuttings or skate for some
distance up or down the river to get around them.
New ice had formed in the lanes and it looked
fairly thick. Roy slowed down and examined it.
Then he struck at it with the heel of one skate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
found that it didn’t break, and skated quickly
across. It was a narrow lane down which the
cakes of ice had been floated to the house and he
was soon over it. Then came thick ice again. He
looked up the river. The boat was still before the
wind and had passed Dick while that youth was
some distance away. Now he had paused, apparently
undecided whether to remain there or to
join the others down-stream. Harry had already
given up the chase and headed toward the ice-houses.
Sid and Chub were still chasing madly
about in mid-stream. Roy shouted and the wind
carried his voice so well that both Harry and Dick
heard and waved to him. Then a wide expanse of
new ice confronted him and as he skated unhesitatingly
on to it he noted the different sound which it
gave forth under his blades. And then, without
the least warning, the surface gave beneath him
like paper and he was fighting for breath with the
green water ringing in his ears and clutching at
his heart with icy fingers.</p>

<small>HARRY EVENS OLD SCORES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It seemed to Roy many long minutes before he
ceased to sink and was able to struggle upward
again to the surface and daylight. Luckily the
current was sluggish at that point and when he
came up he found himself in the pool of broken
ice. Afterward, remembering how thin that ice
proved to be, he wondered that it had held him
for as long as it had. But now, gasping for breath,
choking and numbed with the cold, his only
thought was to find something to support him until
help came. He gave no outcry, it never occurred
to him to do so, nor, for that matter, had he breath
for it. Weighted with skates and heavy clothing,
including the thick crimson sweater which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
usually wore, he was seriously handicapped from
the start. And to make matters worse, the thin
ice broke under the slightest weight he put upon
it. If he could keep himself afloat long enough to
break his way to the side of the cutting and reach
the thick ice he might hold on until some one
reached him. But the chill in his body threatened
cramp every instant and made him feel as weak as
a kitten. Gasping and choking, he fought hard,
smashing the ice with one mittened hand and using
the other to keep himself afloat. Now and then,
in spite of his efforts, the water with its scum of
floating ice fragments rose across his face, and
each time a dreadful fear gripped him. But he
thrashed and fought his way back again and again,
each struggle leaving him weaker than before.
There was no time to look for succor; he saw only
the horrid brittle surface against which he battled.
He could not tell whether he was working
toward thick ice or not.</p>

<p>By degrees hopelessness seized him and he began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to feel indifferent; the lower part of his body
seemed to have left him; he believed that he was
working his legs in an effort to tread water, but
there was no sensation there. Once he stopped
struggling, and only when the water had closed
over his eyes did he realize that he was sinking.
Then, terror mastering him, he fought blindly and
impotently for an instant. But the effort did not
last; he was too weak now to even break the imprisoning
ice; a pleasant lassitude crept over him.
It was no use, he told himself; he was going to
give up. And having reached that decision he experienced
a delicious sensation of relief. He had
no thought of drowning; he was merely going to
rest, to sleep; and he was glad, because he could
not remember ever having been so dead tired!
And then two things happened simultaneously; he
heard his name called and found his fingers tightening
about something that was not ice, something
that did not break and dissolve in his grasp. With
a sudden return to his senses he opened his eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
said “Hello, Harry,” quite calmly and closed
them again. He did not remember much about it
after that.</p>

<p>When Roy had shouted Harry had heard and
waved to him. She was already skating toward
him, although a long distance away, and when, an
instant later, she had looked again to find only
empty ice where he had been she realized instantly
what had happened. With a shrill cry of warning
to Dick, some distance behind, she flew onward,
skating harder than she had ever skated before.
But the wind was almost dead ahead of her and
seemed to be striving to beat her back with its
savage blasts. She repeated a little prayer to herself
over and over as she sped along, in time to the
ringing of her skates: “Please, God, let me be in
time! Please, God, let me be in time!” And
presently, as she drew near, she saw Roy’s head
above the surface and was sure that her prayer
would be answered. Off came the brown sweater
with the white F. H. upon it and away blew Harry’s
tam-o’-shanter across the ice. And then she
was down on her knees, crawling anxiously across
the edge of the treacherous surface.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112-<br />113]</a></span></p>

<p>Roy, with white face and closed eyes, his light
brown hair plastered down upon his forehead, was
beating the air feebly with his hands. With a
silent prayer for success <a href="#image07">Harry caught her
sweater by the end of one sleeve and tossed it toward
him</a>. It fell beside his hand but the wind
whipped it past. Again she tried, calling his name
as she did so, and a corner of the sweater fell
under his grasping fingers and with relief she
felt the garment strain and tighten. Roy opened
his eyes and looked at her; even smiled a little, she
thought; and said her name. Then she was putting
all her strength into keeping her place, for he had
closed his eyes again and seemed bent upon pulling
her after him into the water. But help was close
at hand. With a shout of encouragement Sid came
racing up, followed breathlessly by Chub and
Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on a minute more,” cried Dick. “Get
hold of my legs, Chub, and I’ll work out to him.”</p>

<p>But even after Dick had seized Roy firmly by
the hands and was himself lying half in the water
it was no easy task for the others. Chub had Dick
by the ankles and Sid held onto Chub, but it was
slow work getting back to solid ice. Yet in the end
they succeeded, and Roy, dripping and unconscious,
lay safe.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” whispered Sid brokenly.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” Dick panted. “But we’ve got
to get him home mighty quick or he will catch cold
and have pneumonia and all sorts of things.” As
he spoke he peeled off his sweater and wrapped it
around Roy’s shoulders. “Let me have yours,
you fellows,” he commanded.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Harry. “There’s the ice-boat!”</p>

<p>Chub’s signaling was unnecessary, however, for
the two occupants of the boat had already seen the
catastrophe and were headed toward the group.
Harry’s sweater, as well as Chub’s and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
worn by Sid, were thrown over Roy, and Dick and
Chub were rubbing and slapping him when the ice-boat
rounded to and came up into the wind with
flapping sail.</p>

<p>“Want any help?” asked one of the occupants.</p>

<p>“Yes, we want to get him home right away,”
answered Dick. “Can you take him aboard and
get him to the Ferry Hill landing?”</p>

<p>“Sure! You pile out, Bob. Lift him in here,
will you? There isn’t much room, but I guess
you can get him on somehow. That’s the ticket.
Shove her nose around, Bob. All right! I’ll meet
you over there!”</p>

<p>The sail filled and the boat, with Roy lying like
a log in the tiny cockpit and Joe Thurston
crouched beside him, leaped away. The others,
shouting their thanks to the marooned Bob, who,
having no skates, decided to stay where he was
until his chum returned to pick him up, hurried
after the boat. At any other time they would
have felt the cold terribly, deprived as they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of their sweaters, but just now they were far too
excited. All talked at once as they raced along
and Harry was forced to listen to much enthusiastic
praise of her pluck and readiness. When
they reached the landing the boat was up on the
beach and Joe Thurston had lugged Roy into the
boat-house, where, warmed by the piled-up sweaters,
he was beginning to take an interest in life
once more. He waved a hand at them as they
entered, but he still looked pretty white and
weak.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a fine one, aren’t you?” asked
Chub in simulated disgust. “What were you trying
to do? Commit suicide?”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t scold him!” cried Harry. “He
almost drowned!”</p>

<p>“I guess I would have if it hadn’t been for
you,” said Roy soberly. “Thanks, Harry; you’re
a trump.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mention it,” answered Harry flippantly,
to hide the fact that her lip was trembling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
“Besides, I just evened things up. You know,”
she explained, turning to Dick, “I might have
burned up to a cinder last winter if it hadn’t been
for Roy. My dress caught on fire at an entertainment
we gave and I came pretty near frizzling, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Chub. “You two are even
now.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Harry, “I didn’t do anything
much, after all. It was Dick and the others who
got you out.”</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for you,” said Dick, “he
wouldn’t have been there when we reached the
place. I didn’t know anything about it until I
heard Harry scream. Then I saw her hitting the
high places down the river and guessed what was
up. Say, Harry, you sure did skate some!”</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better be getting back,” said Joe
Thurston, edging toward the door. “Bob will be
frozen if I don’t. I hope you’ll be all right,” he
added to Roy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks; and I’m awfully much obliged to you
for bringing me across,” answered Roy.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Dick. “It was mighty nice
of you. Want any help with the boat?” Joe protested
that he didn’t. At the door he hesitated
and finally asked, looking at Dick:</p>

<p>“Say, are you the fellow that came to our
school and left?” Dick nodded.</p>

<p>“I’m the chap,” he said. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” was the reply. “Only—” and
this was said over his shoulder as he went out—“only
I’m sorry you didn’t stay!”</p>

<p>“Cheeky cuss!” muttered Sid.</p>

<p>“I think he meant it for a compliment,” laughed
Chub.</p>

<p>“Of course he did!” exclaimed Harry. “And I
think he’s a real nice boy, and I’m going to tell
his sister so. It’s too bad he goes to Hammond, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you kidnap him too?” asked Chub
mischievously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now what are we going to do with you, Roy?”
interrupted Dick. “Want a carriage or an automobile?
Or do you think you can walk if we give
you a boost now and then?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can walk! And look here, you
fellows, I don’t see that it’s necessary for people
to know about this, is it?”</p>

<p>“I guess the fellows’ll find out pretty quick,”
said Chub.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you go and tell them. How about
you, Harry?”</p>

<p>“I won’t say anything unless some one asks
me,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then,” said Roy. “Here,
take some of these sweaters; you folks must be
freezing to death. I’m as warm as toast now.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t make any difference,” Dick declared.
“You keep as many of those around you as you
can. And when you get up the hill you sneak up
to the dormitory and lie down and keep warm until
supper time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“You ought to have some peppermint tea,” said
Harry. “I’ll make some and give it to Chub to
take over to you. It’ll warm you up inside
beautifully!”</p>

<p>The program was carried out as arranged, and,
save that for the rest of the evening Roy felt
rather played out, he experienced no unpleasant
results from his adventure. Of course the meeting
of the F. H. S. I. S. called for that evening did not
take place, for although Roy professed his readiness
to attend, the others would not hear of it.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a shock,” declared Harry firmly,
“and must be very careful of yourself for several
days. I’ll make some more peppermint tea for
you to-morrow, and, and—what are you making
such a face about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, only couldn’t you manage to get
a little sugar into it the next time?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I put any—” began Harry. “Oh, I
didn’t, did I? I’m awfully sorry, Roy! Was it
terribly nasty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, there are some things I haven’t tasted,”
answered Roy judicially, “but it was pretty bad,
Harry.”</p>

<p>“I forgot all about the sugar,” Harry mourned,
“but I’ll put in enough the next time to make
up!”</p>

<p>As Chub had predicted, the story of Roy’s accident
and rescue was all over school on Monday,
while on Wednesday a graphic and highly-colored
account of it appeared in the Silver Cove paper.
One result was that Harry found herself once
more in the glare of publicity at Madame Lambert’s
School and another was that Doctor Emery
promulgated a rule restricting skating on the river
to the immediate vicinity of the boat-house.</p>

<p>On Monday forenoon at eleven <a href="#image08">there was a full
attendance of the Improvement Society</a> in the
barn. It was such a busy meeting that it is quite
impossible to give an account of it in detail.
Strange to say, every one had tried his or her hand
at composing an appeal to the graduates, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
they had agreed to do, and each one read his production
aloud and listened good-naturedly to the
criticisms from the others which followed.</p>

<p>“What we’ve got to do now,” said Dick, “is
take these four and work them over into one. But
I suppose there isn’t much hurry about that, because
we decided that the best way to begin is to
make an appeal to some chap with a lot of money
and get him to give a lump as a starter. To do
that we’ve got to find out who the rich ones are.
That means taking the Doctor into the scheme the
next thing. So I move that Roy and Chub be appointed
a committee of two to wait on him this
afternoon, or as soon as possible, and tell him
about it. And Harry and I will get to work on this
circular.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Chub, “if I must I must, but it
seems to me that Dick ought to take my place because
he can talk a lot better and explain the
thing.”</p>

<p>“Let Roy do most of the talking,” advised
Dick. “I have no objection to taking your place,
only you’re an old boy here and I’ve just come;
he’d pay more attention to what you said.”</p>

<p>“All right,” sighed Chub. “I’m the goat.”</p>

<p>“And Roy’s the goatee,” added Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s do it this afternoon,” said Roy,
“and get it over with.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dick, “and we’ll meet again here
this evening and hear the committee’s report.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried Chub. “That’s me! I’m
a Committee!”</p>

<p>“You’re only half a one,” Roy objected. “I
appoint myself chairman of the committee.”</p>

<p>“Seconded,” said Chub. “The chairman does
the talking, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to tell papa that we’ve elected
him honorary president,” reminded Harry.
“That will please him, I know.”</p>

<p>“Bet you he’ll kick us out!” murmured Chub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” laughed Dick. “Roy, as
chairman, will receive all the honors. You can
dodge.”</p>

<p>Methuselah, who up to this point had been huddled
silently in a corner of his box, with only one
beady eye showing, began to chuckle softly.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Dick, “old ’Thuselah’s awake.
I thought he was frozen up. Hello, you old
rascal!”</p>

<p>The parrot put his head on one side and walked
slowly to the front of the box.</p>

<p>“Howdy do?” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Pretty well, thanks,” answered Chub. “How
are you?”</p>

<p>“Stop your swearing,” replied Methuselah
severely. “Can’t you be quiet?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a nice way to answer a polite
inquiry,” said Chub. “You ought to teach him
better manners, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I can’t teach him anything,” mourned Harry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
“He knew all he knows now when I got him. Roy
and I tried one day to—”</p>

<p>“Roy,” observed Methuselah slowly, experimentally.
Then, as though to hide his embarrassment,
“Well, I never did!” he shrieked. The four
stared at each other in astonishment. Harry
found her voice first.</p>

<p>“That’s the first new thing he’s ever said!”
she whispered in awe.</p>

<p>“See if he will say it again,” Dick suggested.
But in spite of all their coaxing Methuselah was
obdurate. You would have thought he had never
heard the word in his life, much less pronounced
it.</p>

<p>“Well, it shows who’s the favorite, anyhow,”
laughed Chub.</p>

<p>Harry blushed a little and answered quickly:</p>

<p>“That’s because Roy has been nice to him, and
doesn’t make fun of him.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” teased Chub, “but I notice he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
doesn’t break out with my name or Dick’s. And
Dick just loves him; don’t you, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” answered Dick, walking over
and rubbing Methuselah’s head through the slats.
“We’re pretty good friends considering that we
haven’t known each other very—<em>Ouch! Great
guns!</em>”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” laughed Roy.</p>

<p>“Why, he pretty near bit my finger off! ’Thuselah,
you’re a hypocrite. After this when you
want your old top-knot scratched you ask Roy;
I’m through with you.”</p>

<p>“Did he hurt you much?” asked Harry anxiously.</p>

<p>“No,” said Dick, “he just nipped me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was just a love-nip,” said Chub.
“That’s the way he shows his affection. He’s
so fond of me that I have to keep away from him;
I was getting all black-and-blue spots!”</p>

<p>“You’re a naughty ’Thuselah,” said Harry
sternly. “For that you shall go to bed. Good-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>She let the piece of canvas fall over the front
of the box. For a moment there was silence. Then
came a subdued rustling followed by insulted mutterings:</p>

<p>“Well, I never did!” croaked Methuselah.</p>

<p>“Is the meeting over?” asked Chub. “Because
I’ve got about two minutes to find my books and
get to class.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dick. “It’s adjourned until
to-night at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m off! This half of the committee has
duties!”</p>

<p class="cap">“You tell him,” said Roy, subsiding on to an
inverted bucket with a sigh.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Chub; “you’re chairman
and you’ve got to make the report to the—er—meeting.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t have to tell me anything,”
said Harry, who had just entered and was unbuttoning
the cape which she had worn across from
the Cottage. “Papa told mama about it at supper.
He—he thinks it’s a joke!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Roy ruefully, “that’s just
what he does think.”</p>

<p>“But you told him it wasn’t, didn’t you?”
Dick demanded impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, several times, but he only smiled and said
he guessed it wasn’t quite practical—”</p>

<p>“Practicable,” corrected Chub.</p>

<p>“Practical!”</p>

<p>“Practicable; I noticed especially and thought
what a nice word it was.”</p>

<p>“Look here, I’m chairman, and if I say practical—”</p>

<p>“Practical it is,” said Chub. “I’ll lick the first
fellow that says anything else. I remember perfectly—”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, you two, and talk sense!” said Dick.
“Do you mean that he has forbidden us to go
ahead with it?”</p>

<p>Roy looked at Chub and Chub looked at Roy,
and presently each shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t forbid anything,” answered
Roy finally. “He just laughed and—and—”</p>

<p>“Acted as though he was humoring a couple of
mild lunatics,” added Chub resentfully.</p>

<p>“But what objections did he make?” Dick
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Objections? Oh, he wasn’t very—what do
you call it?—specific. He thought at first we were
fooling and then when we both told him we
weren’t, that we’d started the scheme and that
we’d made him honorary president, he—”</p>

<p>“Laughed as though he had a fit,” finished
Chub, smiling broadly himself in recollection.</p>

<p>“But what did he <em>say</em>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he said he guessed we wanted a dormitory,
but that we’d better not force events—or something
like that; said thirty thousand was a big
sum to raise and that maybe we’d better wait
awhile and see—see how things shaped themselves.”</p>

<p>“Whatever that means,” added Chub.</p>

<p>“Did he accept the honorary presidency?” Dick
asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; he said something polite, but I
don’t believe he was much impressed.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t decline it?”</p>

<p>“No; did he, Chub?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nary a decline,” Chub chuckled. “He said
something about you, Dick.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“Said he liked your enterprise, but maybe
you’d better apply some of it to your studies.”</p>

<p>“I’m disappointed in papa,” said Harry sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, don’t you care,” Chub replied cheerfully.
“We’ve had a lot of fun out of the scheme.
I guess none of us really expected to make a go of
it, anyhow, so there’s no sense in being disappointed.
I move that the treasurer be instructed
to return the subscriptions and that the Ferry
Hill School Improvement Society be declared disbanded.”</p>

<p>There was silence. Harry and Roy looked questioningly
at Dick, who, in turn, was gazing
thoughtfully at the lantern.</p>

<p>“Any one second that?” continued Chub.</p>

<p>Again silence fell. Finally Dick looked up.</p>

<p>“There’s no use in you folks trying to bust up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the society,” he said; “because if you do I’ll organize
it again.”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed Chub. “But what’s the
use, Dick? We can’t do anything without the
Doctor’s help, and he’s as good as told us to forget
it!”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t forbidden us to raise the money
for a new dormitory,” said Dick doggedly, “and
I, for one, am going to go ahead. If any of the
rest of you want to stay in and help, all right; if
not, you can withdraw and I’ll go it alone.”</p>

<p>“I want to stay!” cried Harry promptly.</p>

<p>“Well—” began Roy.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t scare me,” said Chub. “If you
want to go ahead, I’m right with you. I don’t see
what we can do, but I’ll stick as long as any one.
We’ll nail the flag to the mast, by jingo! ‘Shoot,
if you will, this old grey head, but spare your
country’s flag! she said!’”</p>

<p>And Chub danced a jig on the barn-floor, his
shadow leaping about huge and grotesque against
the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t want to drop out,” declared Roy.
“I’m as much in earnest about this as any of you.
But what’s your scheme, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t any,” answered Dick promptly. “But
I’ll find one pretty quick. Ferry Hill’s going to
have that dormitory! You wait and see! It may
take longer than I thought, but it’s coming. I’ll
think up a way, all right; just you give me time.”</p>

<p>“Good for you!” said Chub soberly. “I believe
you will, Dickums. And I’m with you. I
never believed much in that dormitory before, but
hanged if I can’t pretty near see it to-night!”</p>

<p>“You could make a fellow believe in any old
thing, Dick,” laughed Roy. “You ought to be a
general or something in the army and lead forlorn
hopes.”</p>

<p>“What’s a forlorn hope?” demanded Chub.
But no one paid any attention to him.</p>

<p>“Then I’m still secretary and treasurer!”
cried Harry. “I was <em>so</em> afraid you were going to
break up the Society!”</p>

<p>“No, we’re not going to do anything of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
sort,” said Dick stoutly. “We’re going right
ahead, only we’re going to keep it quiet until we
get things started. We can’t look for help from
the honorary president, and so—”</p>

<p>“From who?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“The honorary president, Doctor Emery. He
hasn’t declined the office, so he’s still it, whether
he knows anything about it or not.”</p>

<p>“That’s lovely!” cried Harry, clapping her
hands and beating her heels against the grain
chest on which she was seated. “It’s such a
dandy joke on papa!”</p>

<p>“Well, he won’t help us,” Dick went on, “and
so we’ll have to make a new start in a new direction.
And I’ll have to find what that new direction
is. But you folks want to think about it, too;
four heads are better than one. And now, as it
seems to be about a thousand degrees below zero
in here, I move we adjourn.”</p>

<p>“When’s the next meeting?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We won’t have another until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
somebody has thought up something. We’ll adjourn
subject to the call of the president.”</p>

<p>“That’s great!” said Chub. “I never did that
before. It makes me feel real chesty. The secretary
and treasurer will kindly carry the lantern so
she won’t break her neck. I hope the next time we
hold a meeting the janitor will manage to have the
rooms of the society a little more comfortable as
regards heat. I think I have chilblains.”</p>

<p>“Let’s discharge that janitor,” laughed Roy as
they went out.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Dick. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Methuselah,” answered Chub promptly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days later Chub and Roy encountered each
other in the campus. As though at a prearranged
signal each exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Where’s Dick?”</p>

<p>Then again, speaking together like members of
a chorus:</p>

<p>“That’s what I was going to ask,” they added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s become of him?” added Roy. “I
haven’t seen him more than twice since Monday
night.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, I guess. I thought maybe he was at the
Cottage, but Harry says she hasn’t seen him.”</p>

<p>“Was he at dinner?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder where—I tell you! Maybe he’s
in the library. Did you look there?” Roy shook
his head.</p>

<p>“No, that seemed an unlikely place to find him.
What would he be doing there?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” said Chub. “Maybe he’s grinding.
He’s been having a hard old time lately, I
guess, with Cobb; Cobb asked him in class the
other day if he had ‘an inherent antipathy’ for
French.”</p>

<p>“What did Dick say?” asked Roy with a smile.</p>

<p>“Said no, he guessed it was ‘a constitutional
repugnance!’”</p>

<p>“Lovely!” laughed Roy. “Was Cobb peeved?”</p>

<p>“No, he just sort of grinned and told Dick he’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
better amend his constitution. Let’s go over and
see if he’s there.”</p>

<p>So they got into sweaters and gloves again and
battled their way across to School Hall. At first
glance their search looked to be fruitless, for none
of the half-dozen boys about the big table in the
library proved to be Dick. But Roy stepped inside
the door and spied their quarry down in a corner of
the room by the magazine shelves. He was seated
on the top of the little step-ladder with a magazine
spread open on his knees and his head bent closely
above it. Roy and Chub tiptoed softly toward him,
but he heard them coming, and smiled placidly
as they drew near. Roy thought he turned the
pages of the magazine, but was not sure; at all
events when Roy snatched it out of his hands it
was opened at an article entitled “The Art of Fly-Casting.”</p>

<p>“What are you reading that silly rot for?” he
whispered. “Come on over to the study-room and
talk to us.”</p>

<p>But Dick shook his head calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m very comfortable here,” he answered.
“I’m improving my mind.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t say that isn’t possible,” whispered
Chub scathingly; “but you’d better be
studying other things than fly-casting. Come on,
Dick.”</p>

<p>But Dick was obdurate and as the rules forbade
noise or scuffling in the library they were forced
to let him have his way. But they had the satisfaction
of telling him softly but earnestly what
they thought of him, and Chub even managed dexterously
to get a grip on his neck and force him to
rub his nose against the magazine before leaving
him. When they reached the door and looked
back Dick was once more intently reading.</p>

<p>“Silly chump!” growled Chub as they reached
the hall. “What’s he want to study fly-casting
for, especially at this time of year?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he was reading that at all,” answered
Roy. “I think he turned the pages before
we got to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“He did? Let’s go over after supper and look
through that magazine. Did you notice what it
was?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not what number; and as there’s a
whole row of them I guess we’d have a long hunt.
We’ll make him tell us the truth when we get hold
of him.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll bet he’s up to something,
though.”</p>

<p>But when supper was over and they looked
around for Dick that person had again disappeared.
They searched the two dormitories and
then traveled across to the library again. There
sat the missing one, perched once more on the top
of the step-ladder with a magazine before him.
This time they didn’t enter, for Mr. Buckman was
on the other side of the room and they knew he
would not allow any conversation. For a while
they huddled about the radiator in the corridor
and waited for Dick to appear. But he didn’t
come, and as each had studying to do, presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
they were forced to depart without him. But Dick
couldn’t hope to elude vengeance forever, and
when bedtime came he found himself in the hands
of his enemies.</p>

<p>“How’s your mind coming on?” asked Chub
very sweetly, as he pulled Dick over backward on
his bed and sat on him. “Improving, is it?”</p>

<p>“Know all about fly-casting by this time, I suppose,”
remarked Roy, as he rubbed the captive’s
nose the wrong way. “It’s a fine thing to know
about, fly-casting, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Oh, great!” Chub agreed, jumping himself up
and down to an accompaniment of groans from
Dick. “When I consider, Roy, how little I know
about fly-casting I’m utterly appalled at my
ignorance. And think of the time we’re wasting,
too! Why, we might be out on the river all day
long, Roy, casting the merry little fly across the
ice. Think of that, will you?”</p>

<p>“Let me up!” groaned Dick.</p>

<p>“What? Let you up? Why, Chub, I think you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
sitting on the gentleman! How careless of you!
Kindly remove yourself from the Champion Fly-Caster
of Ferry Hill School. Let him up, Chub,
and he will cast a few flies for us. Kindly look
around, Chub, and catch a fly or two.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me,” begged Chub almost tearfully,
“that this gentleman here is Mr. Somes, the
World-Famed Fly-Caster! Don’t tell me that I
have offered such an indignity to one so—so honored!
I beg of you not to tell me, Roy!”</p>

<p>“You get—off of me—or I’ll tell—you something—you
won’t want to—hear!” gasped Dick,
kicking wildly.</p>

<p>“The gentleman seems uneasy, Roy,” said
Chub. “Supposing you place your thumb on his
nose and bear down gently but firmly. There,
that’s it! I beg your pardon, sir? You will do
what? You will kick— Roy, did you ever hear
such language in all your life? Isn’t it disgraceful?
Why, he absolutely threatens us with bodily
harm! My dear Mr. Fly-Caster, let me beg of you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to calm yourself! There, I feared you would hurt
yourself! That iron is quite hard, isn’t it!
Broken your shin? Oh, I trust not, Mr. Fly-Caster.”</p>

<p>“Let him up,” laughed Roy. “We’ll be late
for bed, the whole bunch of us.”</p>

<p>“Then let us <em>fly</em>,” said Chub. With a bound he
cleared the bed just ahead of the blow Dick aimed
and went racing down-stairs to the Junior Dormitory.
Roy made for the washroom and as Dick
was encumbered with some of the bedclothes which
had wrapped themselves about his legs during the
struggle, he reached it in safety and was able to
stand off the enemy with a tooth-mug filled with
water until terms of peace were agreed upon.</p>

<p>Strange to say, on the following day Dick was
again mysteriously missing, and this time he was
not to be discovered anywhere. The corner of the
library was deserted, he was not in the dormitory
or the gymnasium, Harry had not seen him and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in short, he seemed to have taken wings and flown.
Roy and Chub were on their mettle and were resolved
to find him and bring him to book. But at
four o’clock in the afternoon, after a whole hour’s
search, they were forced to own defeat.</p>

<p>“I don’t see where he <em>can</em> be,” said Chub.
“We’ve looked everywhere. Look here! I’ll
just bet that Harry knows where he is! Let’s go
over and make her own up.”</p>

<p>But Harry vowed that she knew nothing of
Dick’s whereabouts and the others were again
stumped.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty funny,” growled Chub. “And
he’s up to something too; you mark my words!
He’s up to mischief!”</p>

<p>“And we’re not in it,” grieved Roy.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Harry suddenly. “Have you tried
the barn?”</p>

<p>“No!” answered the others in a breath. “Come
on!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>They raced together along the curving drive
and reached the barn quite out of breath. Chub
held up a warning finger.</p>

<p>“He must be in here,” he whispered. “We’ve
looked everywhere else. So let’s surprise him.
Go easy and I’ll try the door.”</p>

<p>They tiptoed up and Chub lifted the wooden
latch. The door yielded. With a frightful yell
Chub threw the door open and they darted in.
There was no one in sight.</p>

<p class="cap">Roy and Chub stared at each other blankly.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Foiled again!” muttered Chub darkly.</p>

<p>The barn was dim save about the open door and
where, high up, the late sunlight found its way
through the dusty window in the loft. They
peered about in the shadows, but saw nothing but
Methuselah’s eyes gleaming uncannily.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s in the loft,” said Roy softly.</p>

<p>“Pshaw, there’s nothing up there but bats and
spiders and dust,” answered Chub. “What would
he be doing here in the dark, anyhow? Come on;
I’m freezing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, let’s yell out and see if he answers,”
Roy suggested.</p>

<p>They called “Dick!” several times, but the only
reply was from the parrot, who chuckled wickedly
in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Roy.</p>

<p>They left the barn, closing the door behind
them, and walked briskly back to the dormitory.</p>

<p>“The only way to do,” said Chub, “is to watch
him and not let him know it. After supper we’ll
keep him in sight and when he sneaks off we’ll
follow him.”</p>

<p>“That’s it! We’ll be detectives,” agreed Roy
with enthusiasm. <a href="#image09">“I’m Sherlock Holmes.”</a></p>

<p>“I’m Vidocq.”</p>

<p>“Who’s he?”</p>

<p>“A French detective,” answered Chub. “He
had Sherlock Holmes fried to a frizzle. Besides,
he was real.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you Holmes could have given him ten
yards and beaten him,” answered Roy stoutly.</p>

<p>“Get out! And Sherlock Holmes is only a fellow
in a book, anyway!”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any difference. He was
the best ever. And I’m he.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll see who discovers the secret
and nabs the criminal,” said Chub. “That’s the
real test. You ought to engage Sid as Doctor Watson;
you know Holmes always had to have Watson
around to run his errands and all that.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; Doctor Watson didn’t do
any of the real detecting; he was just a sort of a
substitute, and sat on the bench. What we ought to
do, Chub, is to disguise ourselves; every detective
uses a disguise.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, but we haven’t got any,” laughed
Chub. “Supposing, though, we turn our sweaters
inside out?”</p>

<p>During supper Dick was watched every moment.
Every time he put his fork to his mouth Chub
scowled knowingly; every time he took a drink of
milk Roy looked meaningly at Chub; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Dick called for a second helping of cold meat the
two detectives smiled triumphantly. When Dick
came out of the dining-hall Roy and Chub were
standing near-by, apparently deeply engrossed in
conversation. Chub saw him coming.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him suspect,” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>With amazing effrontery Dick joined them.</p>

<p>“What are you fellows up to?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Chub with great unconcern.
“Just talking.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Roy, “just talking.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” responded Dick with a grin.
“What are you going to do to-night?”</p>

<p>“Study,” answered Chub promptly. “I’ve got
a lot to do. And so has Roy. We’re going to be
busy.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; so am I,” said Dick. “Don’t
let me disturb you. See you later.”</p>

<p>He put his cap on and walked unhurriedly toward
the door.</p>

<p>“Watch him!” hissed Chub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The door closed behind him. Silently they
waited a moment. Then both sprang toward the
portal and as Roy put his hand on the knob it was
opened quickly from without and Dick confronted
them.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said quizzically. “Going to study
outdoors?”</p>

<p>“N—no,” stammered Roy. “We were—”</p>

<p>“Just going to get a breath of air,” said Chub,
coming to his assistance.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Dick, “well, you’ll find plenty of it
out there.”</p>

<p>He held the door open and the other two sauntered
out, trying to seem at ease. The door closed
behind them. They looked at each other and
smiled sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Where’s he going?” whispered Chub.</p>

<p>“Study-room, maybe. We’ll wait a bit and
then go in. You go up-stairs and I’ll look around
down here. He’s on to us, isn’t he?” Chub
nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure,” he answered. “But it won’t help him.
Vidocq is on his tail—trail, I mean.”</p>

<p>“And so is Sherlock Holmes,” muttered Roy.
“Come on; we’ve been out long enough to get the
air.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got all I want,” replied Chub with a
shiver as they entered the corridor again. “You
look in the study-room and I’ll go up-stairs.”</p>

<p>Roy nodded and they separated. Chub found
both dormitories seemingly empty, but to make
certain that Dick was not in hiding he looked under
all the beds. This took some time and when
he got down-stairs again and sought Roy he was
not to be found. There were several boys in the
study-room and as Chub entered unconcernedly
Whitcomb looked up from his book with a frown.</p>

<p>“It’s the middle window on the end,” he said.
“And please shut it after you; I’m getting tired.”</p>

<p>“What are you gibbering about?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Whitcomb, “I thought you were in
it too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“In what?”</p>

<p>“The game—or whatever it is. First Dick
Somes comes in and jumps out of the window.
Then Roy comes along and I tell him about it and
he jumps out. And neither of them closes the
window after him, and I’m tired of jumping up,
and— Hi! Where are you going? Well, say,
<em>shut it after you, will you</em>?” But Chub was outside,
up to his knees in a snowbank. Whitcomb
sighed, pushed back his chair and slammed down
the window for the third time. “Isn’t it great to
be crazy?” he muttered disgustedly.</p>

<p>Of course Chub might just as well have gone
out through the front door, but he felt that that
would have been far from professional. He struggled
out of the snowbank and peered about him.
It was very dark and very cold. Lights shone
from the windows of School Hall and from the
Cottage, but there was no sound to be heard and
there was no one in sight. Chub realized that the
correct thing to do was to examine the snow for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
footprints, find the criminal’s and follow his track.
But he had no lantern, not even so much as a
match, and so that course was out of the question.
He wondered where Roy had gone. Perhaps he
had discovered Dick and was on his trail. Well,
it was bitterly cold and there was no sense in
standing there at the edge of the drive and freezing
to death. He’d go over to the library and see
if either Dick or Roy were there. He crossed to
School Hall and as he turned the corner to reach
the doorway a figure detached itself from the shadows
in the angle of the wall and slunk across the
path into a thicket of leafless shrubbery. Chub
paused and drew back into the darkness, his heart
thumping with excitement. The other chap was
discernible, but Chub could not distinguish his
features. For several minutes the two stood
motionless, watching each other. Chub’s toes and
fingers began to ache with the cold. He wished
Dick would go on so that he could move after him
and get warmed up a bit. Finally, just when Chub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
decided that he would have to stamp his feet to
keep them from freezing, the other chap called
across sternly.</p>

<p>“You might as well come out,” he said. “I see
you and I know who you are.”</p>

<p>Chub gave a snort of disgust and walked into
the light.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Roy?” he called.</p>

<p>“Yes, is that— Say, I thought you were Dick!”
responded Roy disappointedly, as he scrambled
out of the thicket.</p>

<p>“That’s who I thought you were,” Chub answered.
“Did you see him?”</p>

<p>“No, he jumped out of the window in the study-room.
I went after him, but when I got out he
was gone. Then I came over to the library and he
wasn’t there. I was wondering where to look for
him when you came sneaking around the corner
there. Where do you suppose he got to?”</p>

<p>“How do I know?” answered Chub shortly.
“You’re a nice Sherlock Holmes, you are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you’re a fine Vidocq,” replied Roy just
as scathingly. Then they laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, we mustn’t stand here in the light,”
said Chub. “Because if he is around here he will
see us.” They drew back into the shadow and the
protection of the building. “What shall we do
now?”</p>

<p>“I guess the best thing to do is to go back and
get to work,” replied Roy. “I’ve got some studying
to do to-night.”</p>

<p>“So have I. I say, let’s let him go to thunder.
Who cares where he is, anyway? If he doesn’t
want us to know what he’s up to I guess we can
worry along without knowing, eh? Besides—”</p>

<p>“<em>Hist!</em>” cautioned Roy. “<em>What’s that?</em>”</p>

<p>A figure emerged from the darkness and paused
some thirty feet away.</p>

<p>“It’s Dick!” whispered Chub, gripping Roy’s
arm tightly.</p>

<p>“He sees us,” Roy whispered back. “He’s
watching us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a moment of suspense. Then:</p>

<p>“What are you boys doing there?” asked Mr.
Buckman’s voice.</p>

<p>“Foiled again!” sighed Chub. “We’re just
playing a—a sort of game, sir,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Porter and Eaton, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, have you got your lessons yet?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then you take my advice and go indoors and
get them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; we were just going,” answered Roy
meekly. The instructor swung past them toward
the entrance of School Hall and the boys went
silently back to the dormitory. As they entered
the study-room Whitcomb looked up wearily.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be fussy,” he said, “but would
you mind using one of the other windows for a
while? That one blows right on my back, and I’ve
got the sniffles now.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">The next day was Friday and as the hockey
team was to play a hard game on the morrow
there was an hour of steady practice on the
rink. That kept Roy busy from the time he had
finished with his last recitation until it was time
to get ready for supper. Chub too spent a busy
afternoon engaged in matters pertaining to the
base-ball team, and so when they met at supper
neither he nor Roy was able to say whether Dick
had disappeared that afternoon. At all events he
was in plain sight now. Roy turned to Chub.</p>

<p>“See how queer he’s acting,” he whispered.
“And he isn’t eating much of anything; I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
been watching him. Look, he doesn’t even know
that his fork is empty!”</p>

<p>It would have been very evident to a much less
careful observer than a detective that Dick was
absent-minded and preoccupied that evening.
Once he laid down his fork and began tracing patterns
on the table-cloth with his thumb nail and
several times he paused with his glass of milk in
mid-air to gaze frowningly into space.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he’s thinking up some scheme to get
that money,” said Chub, after a few moments of
amused observation. But Roy shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s that,” he answered. “He
wouldn’t have to run away out of sight every day
to just think. He’s <em>doing</em> something; you see if
he isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, he can just go ahead and do it for all I
care,” said Chub. “I’m not going to stand around
in the snow to-night, I’ll tell you that.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” replied Roy. “Besides, to-morrow
will be the time to play detective. We won’t have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
anything to do in the morning, Chub, so let’s track
him. Even if we don’t find out anything it will
make him peeved.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice that he got much peeved last
night,” observed Chub dryly.</p>

<p>“Never mind; he won’t get away from us in daylight
as easily as he did then,” responded Roy.
“And whatever he’s up to he will be sure to try
and sneak off in the morning. So let’s watch
him, eh?”</p>

<p>“All right; Vidocq again takes up the relentless
pursuit.”</p>

<p>“What we need,” said Roy, “is a clue. Every
detective ought to have a clue.”</p>

<p>“That’s so; supposing we ask him for one? We
might tell him that if he doesn’t give us a clue
we’ll refuse to pay any more attention to him.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’d feel pretty bad,” laughed Roy.</p>

<p>After supper they went into the study-room and
sat where they could watch the front door. Presently
Dick came down-stairs and passed out. Roy
and Chub looked at each other inquiringly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Chub got half out of his chair. But Roy shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Let him go,” he hissed melodramatically.
“Our time will come!”</p>

<p>After breakfast the next morning, which was
Saturday and a holiday, Chub and Roy went up to
the Junior Dormitory and stationed themselves at
the windows overlooking the campus. Chub from
his post of observation had a clear view of School
Hall and the path to the river, while Roy could see
the gymnasium, the Cottage and the path to the
village. They had left Dick at the breakfast table,
but it was after eight o’clock and he would have to
leave the dining-room shortly. If he came up-stairs
they would hear him, while if he went out of
the building they could not fail to see him. But
the minutes passed and nothing happened to vary
the monotony.</p>

<p>“Bet you he’s gone into the study-room and is
reading,” said Chub disgustedly. “He’s just
mean enough to do that!”</p>

<p>“Well, he won’t read very long, I guess,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Roy cheerfully. “Dick doesn’t care much
for reading.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed.</p>

<p>“Anything doing, Sister Ann?” asked Chub
boredly.</p>

<p>“Not much. Billy Warren and Pryor are going
over to the gym and Sid and Chase are throwing
snowballs down here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, let’s call it off. It’s a dandy day
and I’m not going to waste it up here. Let’s go
skating. We’ll get Harry and—”</p>

<p>“S-sh! There he goes!” whispered Roy
hoarsely. Chub ran to the other window.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him see us,” he said. “He’s going
to the village, I’ll bet. We’ll wait until he gets
past the gym and then we’ll scoot down.”</p>

<p>Dick was swinging off along the path with long
strides. In a moment he had passed the gymnasium
and was making for the gate in the hedge.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Chub.</p>

<p>Side by side they raced down-stairs, seized their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
caps from the rack in the hall and then cautiously
opened the door. Dick was out of sight. They
hurried after him. At the gate they paused and
reconnoitered.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Chub. “He’s just turning
into the road toward the Cove. Come on, but
keep low.”</p>

<p>So they skulked across the athletic field and
reached the road just in time to see Dick pass
around the first turn, some three hundred yards
away. It is a mile to Silver Cove and for that distance
Chub and Roy stalked Dick tirelessly. They
had to keep at the side of the road lest he should
turn around and see them, and frequently, when
the road ran straight for some distance, they were
forced to hide in the bushes or behind walls. Luckily,
however, there are many twists and turns between
Ferry Hill and Silver Cove, and so the detectives’
task was not so difficult. Never once, as
far as they could tell, did Dick look back.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t suspect,” said Roy triumphantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” chuckled Chub, “little does he reck that
the human bloodhounds are hot upon his trail.”</p>

<p>“What’s reck?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Don’t you study English?” scoffed Chub.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I never heard of reck. I don’t believe
there is such a word.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, my boy. When we get back
I’ll show it to you in a book I was reading the
other day. Look out!”</p>

<p><a href="#image10">They scuttled hurriedly to the side of the road
and subsided in the bushes.</a> Dick had stopped and
was standing in the middle of the road looking intently
at what appeared to be a roll of paper which
he had taken from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Must be a map,” said Roy. “Perhaps he’s
lost his way.”</p>

<p>Chub laughed. “Whatever it is, I wish he’d
put it away again and go on. There’s a peck of
snow down the back of my neck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, little you reck,” said Roy cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You dry up,” growled Chub. “There he goes;
come on.”</p>

<p>Dick had thrust the roll of paper back into an
inner pocket of his coat and was once more on his
way.</p>

<p>Ferry Hill is only a small town and the business
portion of it occupies but a few blocks along the
main street, which runs to the river and the
bridge. Dick turned to the left there, and Roy and
Chub hurried after. When they reached the corner
they peeked cautiously around just in time to
see their quarry enter one of the stores.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t get too near,” said Roy, “or he
will see us when he comes out.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go over to the drug store, buy some hot
chocolate and watch through the window,” suggested
Chub. That seemed a good plan and they
followed it. The drug store was almost opposite
the shop which Dick had entered and for several
minutes the detectives sipped their hot chocolate
and watched for him to reappear.</p>

<p>“It’s a stationery store,” said Chub. “Wonder
what he wants there.”</p>

<p>“When he comes out,” said Roy, “one of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
might go over and find out what he bought. That
might give us a clue.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’d get separated. He is a dangerous
man and we must stick together for mutual
protection. I wish he’d hurry up.”</p>

<p>They finished their chocolates and Chub bought
ten cents’ worth of lemon drops. They munched
those for a while, their eyes fixed on the door of
the stationery store. Ten minutes passed. Then
Chub grew uneasy.</p>

<p>“He must have come out,” he said.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t have. I’ve been watching every
instant.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s a back door and he’s gone out
that way!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Why would he do that? He didn’t
know we were following him.”</p>

<p>“N-no; at least, I didn’t think he knew it. But
it looks now as though he did. If he doesn’t come
out in five minutes we’ll go over. We can make
believe we want some pencils or something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” Roy agreed. They cast anxious
glances at the store clock from time to time. Never
had five minutes taken so long to pass! But
finally:</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Roy. “Time’s up.”</p>

<p>“We’ll ask for some pencils if he’s there,”
whispered Chub as they crossed the street. The
stationery store was small and as soon as they had
closed the door behind them they saw that Dick had
vanished. The only occupant was a middle-aged
man who was arranging some boxes on one of the
shelves back of a counter.</p>

<p>“We’re looking for a fellow who came in here
a while ago,” said Roy. “Has he gone?”</p>

<p>“A young fellow about your age?” asked the
shopkeeper. “Yes, he’s been gone about twenty
minutes. But he said you’d be along asking for him
and he left a note. Let me see; where did I put it?”</p>

<p>“A note?” faltered Chub.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said the man. “I guess that’s for
you, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Roy took it and read the address: “Mr. Thomas
Eaton, or Mr. Roy Porter.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, that’s ours,” he muttered, looking
sheepishly at Chub. That youth had thrust his
hands in his pockets and was whistling softly.
Roy unfolded the sheet of paper, read the message
and handed it silently across to Chub. Chub read
it, refolded it carelessly and turned toward the
door.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use waiting,” he said. “By
the way, I suppose he went out the back way,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the shopkeeper. “He wanted
to know if he could get the Ferry Hill road that
way and I told him to keep to the left through the
alley, cross the field back of the saw-mill and—”</p>

<p>“I see. Did he get what he wanted here?”</p>

<p>The man chuckled. “Yes, but he said I wasn’t
to tell you what it was because it was a sort of a
surprise to you boys.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he did, eh?” muttered Chub wrathfully as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
they went out. “He thinks he’s mighty smart,
doesn’t he? Let’s see that note again.”</p>

<p>“You put it in your pocket,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noi">Dear Friends: A red sweater shows up great against the
snow. Sorry I can’t wait for you. <span class="flright">Dick.</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>“It’s all your fault. You might have known
that he could see that sweater a mile off.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think he looked around once,” answered
Roy meekly.</p>

<p>“Nor did I. But he did. He knew all the time
we were following him. He makes me tired. Let’s
go home.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use? Now we’re here let’s bum
around a while. It’s only half-past nine.”</p>

<p>Roy’s advice prevailed. After a while their
good-humor returned and they found the laughable
side of the adventure.</p>

<p>“Dick’s a cute one, all right,” said Chub admiringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“He surely is,” said Roy. “It isn’t many fellows
could fool Sherlock Holmes and Vidocq at
the same time!”</p>

<p>“We’re a nice pair of detectives,” laughed
Chub. “But we’ve got to get even with him somehow,
Roy, and we’re going to do it.”</p>

<p>“I say, let’s tell Harry about it. She’s got
bully ideas—for a girl. Maybe she can suggest
something. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll do it as soon as we get back.”</p>

<p>They had a pretty good time of it until after
eleven; went through the stamping works and saw
them make tin cans and boxes, walked out on the
bridge a way, Roy standing treat for the tolls, and
ended up at the saw-mill. And it was at the latter
place that they found their first clue.</p>

<p>They were sitting on a pile of new boards, basking
lazily in the sunlight and watching the big
band-saw eating its way through the logs, when
one of the men came by and saw them.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said, “want to buy anything?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Roy. “We are just looking.
Are we in the way?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, not a bit. Glad to have you. Only
there was a fellow here the other day buying some
stuff. He was about your style and I thought maybe
you wanted something too.”</p>

<p>“Was he a big fellow with yellow hair?” asked
Chub eagerly. “With a gray sweater on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. Friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. What was he buying?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember; some kind of lumber; two
or three sticks, I guess.”</p>

<p>The man went on and Roy and Chub fell to
speculating eagerly on the meaning of Dick’s purchase.</p>

<p>“What’s he want with lumber?” asked Chub.
“He couldn’t lug it back to school with him!”</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s a clue,” said Roy. “Even if it
doesn’t tell us anything. Let’s get home. We’ll
find him and make him tell us.”</p>

<p>“He won’t, though,” said Chub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>They trudged back in the noonday sunlight over
the snowy road and had almost reached the school
when one of the rattle-trap carriages which hover
about the Silver Cove station overtook them.
They paid no particular attention to it, save to
draw to the side of the road out of its way, until
the occupant of the rear seat addressed them.
Then they looked up to see Dick lolling there at
ease and smiling down at them as he rattled by.</p>

<p>“You’d better hurry up,” he called. “It’s almost
dinner time.”</p>

<p>“<em>What do you think of that!</em>” gasped Chub as
the carriage left them behind.</p>

<p>“He must have plenty of money,” said Roy.
“They charge fifty cents to bring you over from
the Cove.”</p>

<p>“But he’s been over there all the morning when
we thought he was back at school! He—he’s just
fooled us right and left! I wish I’d shied a snowball
at his silly head!”</p>

<p>“Wait till we get hold of him!” muttered Roy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE ADVENTURES OF ESTRELLA</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They were not able to take Harry into their
confidence right away, however, as by the
time they reached school it lacked but a few
minutes of dinner time. And after that meal, when
they called at the Cottage, they found that Harry
had not returned from Silver Cove but had remained
to take dinner with one of her girl friends
in the village. In the dining-room Roy and Chub
had treated Dick with contemptuous indifference
and afterward had observed him pass out of the
building and across to the library with supreme
unconcern. He smiled tauntingly as he passed
them in the corridor, but both Roy and Chub
looked impassively by him.</p>

<p>“Who’s your friend?” asked Chub audibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never met him,” responded Roy loftily.
“Some low person.”</p>

<p>At two Roy had to go and get ready for the
hockey game, and as Chub had nothing better to
do he went with him. During the half-hour of
practice preceding the game and during the contest
itself he watched from the side of the rink
and, with Sid, Whitcomb, Pryor, Post and others
cheered the home team on to a well-deserved victory.
Harry didn’t turn up at the game—an unusual
thing for her—and so it was not until after
supper next day that Roy and Chub found Harry.
They called again at the Cottage and were ushered
by Mrs. Emery into the little parlor. Harry
joined them soon afterward and in a few moments
was made acquainted with the situation relating
to Dick.</p>

<p>“It’s a mystery!” she declared excitedly.</p>

<p>“It surely is,” Roy answered. “And we want
you to help us find out what the silly chap is up
to. Will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll be a detective too!”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Chub, “but I don’t think
I ever heard of a female detective; did you,
Roy?”</p>

<p>Roy shook his head, but Harry protested vigorously.</p>

<p>“There are female detectives,” she asserted
stoutly. “I read of one once in some book. She
was awfully smart and found the stolen diamonds
after every one else had failed!”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Chub. “What was her
name?”</p>

<p>“Why, it was—was—oh, dear, I’ve forgotten
it!”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see how you can be her,” teased
Roy.</p>

<p>“I shall recall it,” answered Harry with dignity.
“Besides, detectives have aliases, don’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the cheap ones do,” replied Roy. “Sherlock
Holmes didn’t change his name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did Vi—Vi—Vidocq?” asked Harry anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, often,” answered Chub. “He was the
real thing, too. He caught more desperate criminals
than Sherlock Holmes ever thought of! And
he was great for disguising himself, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it!” cried Harry. “I must have a
disguise!”</p>

<p>“Wear your hair on top of your head,” suggested
Roy laughingly.</p>

<p>“Put your shoes on the wrong feet,” added
Chub.</p>

<p>“Never you mind,” said Harry with sparkling
eyes. “I know what I shall do. You wait and see.
But if you recognize me—if you penetrate my disguise,
I mean, you mustn’t let on. You won’t, will
you? Because it might spoil everything.”</p>

<p>“You may depend upon us,” replied Roy
gravely.</p>

<p>“We ought to have a password,” Harry continued.
“So when we meet each other we can communicate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘<em>R-r-r-revenge!</em>’” muttered Chub with a
ferocious scowl. Harry clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“That’s it! That’s the password! ‘Revenge!’
Don’t forget it.”</p>

<p>“Trust us,” said Roy. “We think of nothing
else. ‘Revenge!’”</p>

<p>“‘Revenge!’” echoed Harry.</p>

<p>“‘Revenge!’” growled Chub.</p>

<p>Then they looked at each other and laughed enjoyably.
And suddenly Harry gave an exclamation
of triumph.</p>

<p>“I remember!” she cried. “It was Estrella!”</p>

<p>“What was?”</p>

<p>“The name of that lady detective. Estrella—Estrella—oh,
I can’t remember her last name, but
I guess Estrella will do, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think so,” Chub said. “It’s a
fine-sounding name, all right. Roy, allow me to
present you to Miss Estrella, the Lady Sleuth.”</p>

<p>“What’s a sleuth?” asked Harry anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just a slang name for detective.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe lady detectives would use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
slang,” she said. “So I guess I won’t be a sleuth,
if you don’t mind, Chub.”</p>

<p>“Have your own way about it. It doesn’t make
much difference what you call yourself, Harry, if
you’ll only find out what Dick is up to. He’s got
to be punished for the way he has treated us all.
It—it’s a low-down trick, that’s what it is!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we owe him something,” Roy agreed.
“And we’ll pay him back, too. But we must try
and make him think that we aren’t watching him
any more.”</p>

<p>“Yes, lull his suspicions,” said Chub.</p>

<p>“Then maybe he will get careless and we’ll
catch him red-handed.”</p>

<p>“Red-handed!” echoed Harry with gusto. “Isn’t
it lovely? I do wish I could start to-morrow,
but I suppose you can’t detect on Sunday!”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” Roy agreed. “But on Monday we’ll
begin in earnest. We mustn’t let him out of our
sight a moment.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we can help letting him out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
our sight,” Chub objected. “We have our recitations
to attend and Harry has to go to Silver
Cove.”</p>

<p>“Well, after school, then,” answered Roy. “In
the afternoon we’ll—we’ll—”</p>

<p>“Dog his very footsteps,” aided Chub. “I read
that somewhere; good, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” laughed Roy. “Little he recks—!”</p>

<p>“You dry up,” growled Chub good-naturedly,
“and come on home.”</p>

<p>Harry went to the porch with them and there,
at her suggestion, they clasped hands and cried
“<em>Revenge!</em>” together in a thrilling chorus.</p>

<p>“We meet anon,” said Chub. “Farewell!”</p>

<p>And thereupon Vidocq and Sherlock Holmes
slunk away into the enveloping darkness, and Estrella,
muttering “<em>Revenge!</em>” under her breath,
closed the front door and stole stealthily into the
library to ransack the shelves for the detective
story which recounted the adventures and
triumphs of her namesake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day Dick was inclined to be chummy,
but Roy and Chub repulsed his overtures coldly.
And in the afternoon he once more disappeared
and didn’t show up again until supper-time. He
spent most of the evening in the study-room, and
although Roy and Chub watched him surreptitiously
they were unable to gather any incriminating
evidence, since he did nothing more enlightening
than apply himself to his algebra lesson.</p>

<p>There was no hockey practice on Monday, and
so when Roy had finished his last recitation in
School Hall he hurried across toward the dormitory
to dispose of his books, with the idea of then
finding Dick before that mysterious youth had
whisked himself out of sight. But before he had
covered half of the distance between the two buildings
he had forgotten all about Dick. For on the
steps of Burgess stood a most remarkable figure.
Roy stared and marveled. At first he thought he
was looking at an elderly woman, but the next
moment he changed his mind, for the small, slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
form was youthful in spite of the attire. There
was a vividly blue cloth skirt which swept the
ground, a black fur cape, rather the worse for service,
which reached almost to the waist, a large
hat with brown feathers and a heavy black veil
which completely hid the face. One hand clutched
a silver-handled umbrella and the other was lost
in the folds of the voluminous skirt.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a funny-looking scarecrow!” muttered
Roy as he approached. The lady, whoever
she was, seemed to be viewing him from behind
the thick veil, and Roy ceased staring. But as he
mounted the steps he could not resist another look.
Through the close meshes of the veil he caught
sight of two bright eyes and a rather impertinent
nose, and—</p>

<p>“<em>Revenge!</em>” said a smothered voice.</p>

<p>Roy stopped and stared with wide-open mouth.</p>

<p>“I—I beg your pardon, ma-am!” he faltered,
uncertain whether he had imagined it. “Did you
speak?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Revenge!</em>” said the voice again. Roy gasped.</p>

<p>“Harry!” he exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p>“S-sh! Would you betray all?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you’re a sight!” said Roy, standing
off to obtain a better view of her. “Where’d you
get the clothes, Harry?” Then he leaned up
against the opposite railing of the porch and gave
way to mirth. Harry stamped her foot and
thumped the silver-handled umbrella.</p>

<p>“Roy Porter, you’re just as mean as you can
be!” she declared aggrievedly. “And you can do
your own detecting!”</p>

<p>“But, Harry,” Roy gasped, “if you could only
see the way you look!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care; I fooled you all right enough,
Mister Smarty!”</p>

<p>“That’s so; I thought you were an old woman
at first! It’s a dandy disguise, Harry.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” Harry asked, somewhat
mollified. “I had a terrible time getting the
things, because of course I couldn’t ask for them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
if I had, my disguise would have been no longer a
secret, would it?”</p>

<p>Roy shook his head.</p>

<p>“And so I had to swipe—borrow them, I mean,
without saying anything to mama. And if I should
meet her wouldn’t she be surprised?” And Harry
giggled behind the veil.</p>

<p>“I’ll just bet she would,” laughed Roy. “Have
you seen anything of—”</p>

<p>“S-sh! Some one approaches!” cried Harry.
“Follow me, but take no notice!”</p>

<p>Several boys had come out on to the steps of
School Hall and were looking curiously across.
Harry seized the folds of the ridiculous blue skirt
and lifted it so that she could walk without tripping
over it. Then, raising the silver-handled
umbrella in a gesture of caution she turned and
stole stealthily into the building. Roy, vastly
amused, followed. Harry crossed to the dining-room,
opened the door and beckoned. To enter
the dining-room outside of meal-hours was strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
against the rules, but Harry was a law unto herself,
and Roy ventured after her. Then she closed
the door, turned the key in the lock and raised the
black veil.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, “we are safe for the moment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all very well, but supposing Dick
takes it into his silly head to disappear while we
are in here talking?”</p>

<p>“Then we must find him.”</p>

<p>“But we said we were going to watch for him
and follow him. What’s the good of letting him
get away? I left him in School Hall and he will be
out in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“We-ll, maybe we’d better go,” said Harry.
“But I did want to talk to you a minute.”</p>

<p>“All right, go ahead. What do you want to talk
about?”</p>

<p>“Do you think Dick would recognize—would
penetrate my disguise if he met me?” she asked
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’d let you get near enough,”
answered Roy with a laugh. “I’ll bet if he saw
you coming he’d run a mile!”</p>

<p>“Now you’re being mean again,” said Harry
reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Well, honest then, Harry, I don’t believe your
own mother would know you!”</p>

<p>“But she’d know her clothes,” Harry said
laughingly. “Supposing, then, that I go over toward
School Hall and wait for him to come out.
Then I can follow him and he won’t suspect anything.”</p>

<p>“All right, but I wouldn’t let him think you are
after him,” Roy advised.</p>

<p>“Of course I sha’n’t,” answered Harry indignantly.
“Don’t you suppose I know more about—about
detecting than that? I’ll just make believe
that I’m a visitor looking around the school.
And maybe I’ll meet him and ask him some questions.
Wouldn’t that be funny?”</p>

<p>“He’d know your voice in a minute,” said Roy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d disguise it, like this,” Harry replied, sinking
her voice until it sounded like the croak of a
raven. “You couldn’t tell it was me, could
you?”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” Roy declared with emphasis.
“You sound the way Methuselah did the
time he had a sore throat!”</p>

<p>“You’re not very complimentary,” said Harry
with a pout. “But I suppose detectives mustn’t
mind that. Now I think we’d better go, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>Roy agreed and Harry carefully lowered her
veil. At the door she turned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot to tell you,” she said. “I found
that book last night after you went, and my name
is Estrella De Vere. Isn’t it lovely?”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy!” answered Roy. “It sounds
almost real.”</p>

<p>He remained inside until Harry had passed
down the steps and was sauntering with elaborate
unconcern toward School Hall. Then he went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
on to the porch and watched. Harry, her blue skirt
trailing regally behind her, stopped in front of the
entrance, leaned on her umbrella and studied the
architecture of the building. A group of boys on
the porch stopped talking and viewed her curiously.
Presently, with a nod of approval, Harry
turned and walked slowly up the path toward the
Cottage, pausing at length to take in the details of
that modest structure quite as thoroughly. The
boys on the porch, Roy observed, were laughing
and making fun of the queer figure. At that moment
the door of School Hall opened again and
Dick hurried out and along the path toward Harry,
who had now turned and was sauntering back toward
the hall. As he went he cast a quick and
cautious glance about him and Roy, although he
tried to draw back out of sight, knew that Dick had
seen him. Dick’s gaze now was on the person in
the black veil. When he reached the place where
the path to the Cottage branched off from the road
to the barn he seemed to hesitate an instant. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
he turned to the right toward the Cottage and Estrella
De Vere.</p>

<p>By this time Harry had made up her mind to a
desperate venture. As Dick reached her she sank
her voice to sepulchral tones.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, young man,” she said, “but can
you tell me what building that is?” She pointed
the umbrella toward School Hall.</p>

<p>Dick stopped and touched his cap, looking very
intently at the black veil. But Harry kept her
head averted as much as she could and flattered
herself that Dick was far from suspecting her
identity. But she did wish he wouldn’t look so
hard!</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” answered Dick. “That is the
Biological Laboratory.” Harry gave a gasp.
“And further along,” pointing out the dormitory,
“you see the Astronomical Observatory.” Harry
gasped again. Dick swung around and indicated
the gymnasium. “And that building, ma’am, is
called Somes Hall in honor of Mr. Richard Somes,
who gave the money for it. It cost two million dollars
and contains the Phrenological and Optimistic
departments.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194-<br />195]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry had a wild desire to giggle, but conquered
it. She wondered for an instant whether
Dick knew her, after all, and was trying to tease
her. The expression of his face, which was one of
the utmost seriousness, told her nothing. She almost
forgot to disguise her voice as she answered
him.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” she said. “And—and
the small house here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <a href="#image11">that’s the Insane Asylum</a>,” answered
Dick readily. “I have but one case confined there
at present, a young girl. It’s really very sad,
ma’am. I don’t think she will ever be any better.
She imagines”—he dropped his voice to a confidential
whisper—“she imagines that she’s a detective!
Very sad, really!”</p>

<p>He touched his cap again, gravely and politely,
and went on toward the Cottage, leaving Harry a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
prey to conflicting emotions, the strongest of
which was exasperation.</p>

<p>“Now how did he know me?” she wondered.
“I think he’s just as mean as he can be!”</p>

<p>She stood motionless and watched Dick ring the
bell. In a moment the door was opened and he
passed into the Cottage.</p>

<p>“And what do you suppose he’s gone there
for?” she asked herself. “Perhaps he’s going to
tell mama that I’m out here with her old blue
skirt and fur cape on! Let him! I think he’s the
meanest—!”</p>

<p>But at that moment the mystery was explained.
She had put up one hand to make certain of the
arrangement of her veil, which since she had first
donned it had been giving her not a little trouble,
and discovered that it had become undone at the
back, leaving exposed a small expanse of red hair.</p>

<p>“That’s how he knew!” she exclaimed. “If it
hadn’t been for that he’d have been fooled just
as Roy was! Beastly old veil! And I just know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
he’s told mama and they’re having a lovely joke
about it! I’m going in!”</p>

<p>She hurried to the Cottage and attempted the
front door, only to find that it was locked. Wrathfully
she rang the bell. Steps sounded in the hall,
the door was opened a little and Mrs. Emery’s
face appeared for a brief moment. Then,</p>

<p>“Nothing to-day, thank you,” said her mother,
and the door closed again sharply before Harry
had recovered from her surprise. Then she beat
upon the portal with the umbrella and stabbed at
the button until the bell fairly outdid itself. A
window opened up-stairs and Mrs. Emery put her
head out.</p>

<p>“If you don’t go away at once,” she said, “I’ll
call the man to put you off the grounds. We don’t
allow peddlers here.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a peddler!” cried Harry. “I want
to get in! I’m Harry!”</p>

<p>“<em>What! Harry?</em>” exclaimed her mother.
“Well, I am surprised!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>But Harry noticed that she was smiling broadly
as she closed the window and disappeared. In a
moment the door was opened and Harry passed
inside, a little bit sulky.</p>

<p>“You knew it was me,” she declared. “You
just did it to tease me!”</p>

<p>“What, knew you in those clothes?” asked her
mother. “Why, how could I, my dear? And
with that veil over your face? And tied so neatly,
too!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did know; Dick told you! And he’s
as mean as mean can be!”</p>

<p>“Dick? No, Dick didn’t tell me, my dear.
But I saw you leaving the house half an hour ago
and found my blue skirt missing.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Dick?” demanded Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s been gone a long time, I guess. He
came and asked if he might pass through the
house and go out by the back door; he said you
and he were playing a game called—Detective,
wasn’t it? So I told him he might and the last I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
saw of him from my window he was climbing over
the hedge into the ball field.”</p>

<p>Harry sank into a chair, the black veil trailing
from one hand and the silver-handled umbrella in
the other.</p>

<p>“Foiled again!” she cried despairingly.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Harry told her story later to Roy and
Chub, who laughed immoderately and, as
Harry thought at first, somewhat unkindly. But
after a while she joined her laughter with theirs.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a peach!” declared Chub. “He’s
too much for us!”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort!” said Harry. “He got
the better of me to-day, but—”</p>

<p>“A time will come!” suggested Chub.</p>

<p>“And I’ll catch him yet; you see if I don’t!
He’s not so awfully smart.”</p>

<p>“Well, he seems to be a heap smarter than any
of us,” said Roy. “I vote we leave him alone.
When he gets good and ready he will probably
tell us what he’s up to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Leave him alone nothing!” said Chub.
“Even if we can’t find out what he’s doing, we
can make his life a burden to him. And I, for
one, propose to do it. Look at the way he treated
us in Silver Cove the other day! Let him alone?
I guess not!”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” agreed Harry. “It’s war to the
death!”</p>

<p>“‘Revenge!’” suggested Roy laughingly.</p>

<p>“You bet,” answered Chub.</p>

<p>The next day Dick, for some reason, refused to
disappear or even attempt to. And that was a
great disappointment to Harry, who had made all
preparations to follow him and discover his secret—although
without the aid of a disguise. When
they met, as they did several times in the course
of the day, Harry passed him with her small nose
held at a disdainful angle. Dick only grinned.</p>

<p>There was hockey practice that afternoon and
Dick went down to the rink to look on. Of course
Harry and Chub followed at a discreet distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
doing their best to appear unaware of his presence
in the world. During practice Dick stood
across the rink and smiled amusedly at them
whenever they glanced across, a proceeding which
drove Harry to heights of exasperation. Once in
a lull of practice Roy skated up to them.</p>

<p>“Do you see him over there?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>“Of course we do,” answered Harry disgustedly.
“Do you think we’re blind? He’s been
grinning and grinning at us for half an hour.”</p>

<p>Roy shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he muttered, “little he recks—”</p>

<p>Then he dashed away out of Chub’s reach.</p>

<p>But the next day brought triumph to Sherlock
Holmes, Vidocq and Estrella De Vere, proving
the truth of the old adage which declares that he
laughs best who laughs last. For at noon Roy
and Chub, tumbling out of School Hall after a
recitation, found Harry awaiting them. Her eyes
were dancing and she was all excitement.</p>

<p>“Revenge!” she whispered dramatically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good! What’s up?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“I have tracked him to his lair!” whispered
Harry. “All is discovered! The miscreant is in
our power! Estrella De Vere has—”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Harry? Have you found
out about Dick?”</p>

<p>“I have discovered all! Listen!”</p>

<p>And Estrella De Vere, the Female Detective,
with Sherlock Holmes on one side and Vidocq on
the other, passed down the path.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Dick came out of School Hall
and stood for a minute on the porch, looking idly
about him. The snow which had covered the
campus a foot deep a fortnight before was almost
gone, and in places the sere brown turf showed
through the worn and tattered coverlid of white.
It was quite warm to-day, with a muggy atmosphere
and a leaden sky, almost too warm for
snow, and yet feeling very much like it. There was
a steady <em>drip</em>, <em>drip</em> from the eaves and ledges, and
the walks were showing borders of trickling water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Dick frowned and looked anxiously into the sky.
What he saw there seemed to please him but little,
for the frown deepened.</p>

<p>“Two or three days of this sort of weather,”
he muttered half aloud, “and the ice won’t be
worth a cent.”</p>

<p>Then, looking carefully about him again, he
went down the steps and turned to the right
toward Burgess. There were several boys in
sight, but, and this was suspicious, neither Chub,
Roy, nor Harry was to be seen. He took his books
into the study room and deposited them on the
big table. Then, the room being deserted, he
crossed to one of the end windows and looked
stealthily out. Apparently the coast was clear.
But he was taking no chances, and so he stole
around to a front window and viewed the prospect
carefully from there. He seemed puzzled, for he
thrust his hands into his pockets, stared steadily
for a whole minute at the engraving of “Washington
Crossing the Delaware,” which adorned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
wall above the fireplace, and whistled softly to
himself. Then, having apparently decided upon a
course of action, he left the study room, crossed
the corridor and opened a door which gave on to
a descending stairway leading to the cellar.
Down this he went very quietly, reached the furnace
room and from there gained the outer air by
way of a flight of stone steps. He was in a small
stone-paved court behind the building, with the
hedge marking inner bounds but a few paces
away. There was a gate here, and making his
way between a double row of ash barrels he
passed through it and plunged into the Grove.
Then he turned to the right and wound between
the trees, crossing the path to the boat-house and
river at right angles, and keeping well out of
sight of the windows of the halls. Five minutes
of this brought him to the corner of the hedge.
Here the trees ceased abruptly and gave way to
snow-covered fields. Crouching behind the hedge
so that his head was below the top of it, he followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
it at right angles to his first course until opposite
the barn and stables. Here he raised his
head and reconnoitered. There was no one in
sight and presently he was wriggling his way
through a hole in the hedge. From there he
passed around the back of the small stable and
fetched up before a small door leading to the
basement of the barn. That door required careful
handling, for it hung only by one leather
hinge. But Dick managed to get through it, displaying
a certain degree of familiarity with its
idiosyncrasies, and closed it behind him.</p>

<p>He found himself in total darkness, but without
hesitation he crossed the earthen floor and climbed
a narrow flight of steps. As he went upward the
darkness gave way to gray twilight and when he
reached the main floor of the barn behind the cow
stalls it was light enough to allow him to see
distinctly about him. So far he had made scarcely
a sound since entering the building, and now he
crept very quietly along until he could see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
closed door. The barn was deserted save for the
inmates of the boxes across the bare floor, and
even they were so quiet that no one would have
suspected their presence. Dick gave a sigh of
relief and walked less stealthily to the back of the
barn where a ladder led straight upward to the
edge of the loft. He sprang nimbly onto it and
ascended until he could crawl over the edge of the
upper flooring.</p>

<p>In front of him was a space some thirty feet
broad by twenty deep. On one side it was used
as a storage place for a couple of old sleighs, the
remnants of a windmill and similar discarded
truck. On the other side the remains of last
summer’s hay was stowed in a mow which ran
along over the cow stalls. In the center of the
loft, under the small window, was a large packing-box
and beside it was a small one. On the larger
one were spread several sheets of brown paper,
pencils, a square, a rule, a pair of dividers and
other tools of the draftsman. There was a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
light from the window, in spite of the fact that its
four small panes were obscured with dust and
spider webs.</p>

<p>Dick went to his improvised table, took up a
piece of kneaded rubber which lay there, and
played with it while he studied the top sheet of
paper. It was pretty well covered with lines and
figures, but only the designer knew what they
stood for. After a moment he drew the small
box up and sat down on it, discarded the eraser
for pencil and rule and set to work.</p>

<p>It was very quiet in the barn. Now and then
Methuselah moved in his cage and muttered unintelligibly
or a bat squeaked somewhere overhead
in the darkness. Soon Dick was quite oblivious
to everything save the work before him. He drew
lines with his pencil, used ruler and dividers, set
down figures on a smaller sheet of paper and multiplied
or added or subtracted, erased lines already
drawn, and through it all wore a deep frown
which told how wholly absorbed he was in the
task. And so he didn’t hear the soft rustlings
which came from the top of the haymow a few
feet away when three heads were thrust into view.
Heard nothing, in fact, until the silence was suddenly
shattered by a sudden <a href="#image12">“<span class="lcsmcaps">AH, THERE!</span>”</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210-<br />211]</a></span></p>

<p>He heard then; oh, yes, quite plainly!</p>

<p>Down dropped his pencil, over went the smaller
box with a slam and Dick was staggering away in
an effort to find his feet, his face very white and
his mouth wide open for the exclamation of alarm
which he was too frightened to give. There followed
a brief moment of silence during which
Dick stared at the three laughing, triumphant
faces topping the haymow. Then the color crept
back into his cheeks and he slowly closed his
mouth.</p>

<p>“Humph!” he said at last.</p>

<p>“Move hand or foot,” cried Chub dramatically,
“and you are a dead man!”</p>

<p>“We have you in our power at last!” added
Harry. And—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Little you recked,” said Roy.</p>

<p>Dick picked up the box and began to grin.</p>

<p>“Well, you caught me at last, didn’t you?” he
asked. “But I don’t see why Harry left off that
lovely disguise of hers.”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t seen my hair—” began Harry
vehemently.</p>

<p>“Be careful what you say,” interrupted Chub,
sliding down from the top of the mow, “for it will
be used against you.”</p>

<p>The others followed and Roy playfully dug
Dick in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Old Smarty was caught at last, wasn’t he?”
he cried.</p>

<p>“Took you long enough, though,” said Dick.
“And gave you some good exercise, too, eh?”</p>

<p>“We don’t deny, my boy, that you fooled us
very nicely several times,” answered Chub, “but
the expression on your handsome countenance a
moment ago made up for everything.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” laughed Dick. “I was scared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
stiff. How did you find out about this drawing-room
of mine?”</p>

<p>“That was Harry,” said Roy. “She came in
here this morning before school and let ’Thuselah
out of his cage and he climbed up here and
wouldn’t come down. And as she had to hurry
to school she came up and got him and saw the
things here. Then she told us about it and after
school we hurried over here and hid in the hay.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dick regretfully, “I wish I’d
stuck to my first plan and gone to the Cove instead
of coming up here. Then you’d all have had a
nice quiet afternoon in the hay.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t!” said Harry triumphantly.
“And it was the female detective that discovered
you. Sherlock Holmes and Vidocq were out-detected
by Estrella De Vere!”</p>

<p>“Eh?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>Then they told him all about their impersonations
and he thought it was a huge joke, and mollified
Harry completely by congratulating her on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
her triumph over the others. Then they compared
notes for the past week.</p>

<p>“Where did you go the day we followed you to
the stationery store?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“I went out the back door and came around to
the street and watched from the next corner until
you crossed and went into the store. Then I went—about
my business.”</p>

<p>“And that reminds me,” said Roy, “that we
don’t know yet what you’re up to. Are you going
to ’fess up now?”</p>

<p>“Sure. I’d have told you all about it long ago
if you hadn’t begun this detective work. When
I found what you were up to I thought I’d just
give you a run for your money.”</p>

<p>“Is it anything about the F. H. S. I. S.?” asked
Harry. Dick shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied. “The fact is that’s at a
standstill, I guess. I’ve had it in mind right
along, but I can’t think of any way to go ahead.
How about you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t thought of anything,” Harry confessed.
And Roy and Chub answered the same
way.</p>

<p>“Well, it’ll come in time,” said Dick. “How
about the funds, Harry? Got them safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re—but maybe I oughtn’t to tell
where I keep them.”</p>

<p>“Just as well not to, I guess,” Dick laughed.
“Chub might get hard up and borrow them.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Dick, what’s all this mean?” asked
Roy, who was staring perplexedly at the drawing
on top of the packing-case. “Are you inventing
something?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” said Chub, “that’s just a problem
in trig., isn’t it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know all about it, so what’s the use
of asking me?”</p>

<p>“No, go ahead and tell us, like a good fellow,”
said Roy.</p>

<p>“Well, then, it’s the plan of an ice-boat.”</p>

<p>“Ice-boat!” exclaimed the others in chorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, why not?”</p>

<p>“But—but what’s it for?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“To sail.”</p>

<p>“You mean you are going to make one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s being made now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” Chub exclaimed.
“Whatever put that into your crazy head?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve wanted it ever since I saw that one
of Thurston’s the day that Roy took a cold bath.
So I found out all I could about the things; read
everything I could find, you know. That was
what I was doing that night in the library when
you thought I was reading about fly-casting or
something.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t think anything of the kind,” Roy disclaimed.
“I saw you turn the pages as we came
up.”</p>

<p>“Did you? All right. Well, I finally got some
idea about the things and had a talk with a fellow
at the Cove. He builds boats, but has never tried
his hand at ice-boats before. He didn’t want to
have anything to do with it at first, but I finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
got him interested. He said I’d better go to some
fellow at Poughkeepsie or somewhere who knew
all about them, but I told him I wanted it made
where I could have a finger in the pie. So he got
busy. I made the drawings and he’s building
accordingly.”</p>

<p>“Is this it?” asked Roy interestedly, pointing
to the plan before him.</p>

<p>“No, that’s only the sail-plan. The other’s
at the Cove; Johnson has it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you bought the lumber for!” exclaimed
Chub. Dick nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes. And I’ve bought a lot more since then.
It’s costing like anything, but it’s lots of fun.
I want you all to go over with me Saturday and
have a look at it.”</p>

<p>“How big is it, Dick?” asked Roy.</p>

<p>“It’s just a smallish one,” was the answer.
“Twenty-nine feet long by eighteen wide.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” cried Roy. “It doesn’t sound small!
When will it be done?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; about a week, I guess. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
worst thing is figuring about the sails. You see,
I don’t know very much about sailing; never
sailed anything in my life but a kite. So it’s puzzling,
and I’m more than half guessing. Maybe
the fool thing won’t go when it is done.”</p>

<p>“Course it’ll go,” said Chub. “A sail’s a
sail.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s perfectly grand!” said Harry
with awe. “Will you take me out in it, Dick, when
it’s finished?”</p>

<p>“Of course; and if it does manage to go I’m
going to send a challenge to that Thurston chap.”</p>

<p>“Say, that’ll be bully!” cried Chub. “And
I’m just dying to see the thing. Can’t we go over
before Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but it won’t be very far along before
that time. A lot of the bolts and braces had to be
made, and that takes time, you know. Besides,
that’s only three days from now.”</p>

<p>“What color are you going to paint it?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to have her red,” answered
Dick, “but I suppose it wouldn’t do, for that’s
Hammond’s color, and, besides, Thurston’s is
red.”</p>

<p>“Paint her blue,” suggested Roy.</p>

<p>“Pink,” said Chub.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have her green,” Dick said.
“That shows up pretty well at a distance.”</p>

<p>“And call her the <i>Shamrock</i> or the <i>Erin Go
Bragh</i>,” laughed Roy. “What <em>are</em> you going to
call her, by the way?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t thought much about that yet. Usually
they call ’em <i>Icicles</i> or <i>Jack Frosts</i> or <i>Blizzards</i>,
but I’d rather have something a little newer.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can name her after me if you want
to,” observed Chub modestly.</p>

<p>“Yes, call her the <i>Chump</i>,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Let’s all think of names for it,” cried Harry.
“We’ll write them down so as not to forget them
and then we’ll give them to Dick and he can select
one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the one whose name is selected,” suggested
Chub, “gets a prize, like—like not having
to ride on the boat.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be glad enough to ride on her when you
see her,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Who? Me?” queried Chub. “Well, maybe so;
I’m naturally of a brave and reckless disposition.
In fact, as far as I’m personally concerned I’d
like it, but there is the community to think of.
Of course, I owe it to the community to be careful
of myself and not—”</p>

<p>“You’re talking a great deal of nonsense,
Thomas H. Eaton,” said Harry. “If Dick asks
me to go with him I’ll go mighty quick!”</p>

<p>“If it’s any sort of a boat that’s just the way
you will go,” observed Roy dryly. “So quick you
won’t know what’s happening to you.”</p>

<p>“It must be lovely!” cried Harry, clasping her
hands and looking enraptured.</p>

<p>“Has any one seen Thurston’s boat lately?”
asked Chub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Roy answered, “I see it pretty nearly
every afternoon. It’s a hummer, too. I think
he goes over to school on it in the mornings and
back to the Cove in the afternoon, because I’ve
seen him heading that way several times about
the time we get through hockey practice.”</p>

<p>“The only thing I’m afraid of,” said Dick,
with an uneasy glance through the grimy window,
“is that we’ll have a thaw before I get her
ready.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Chub agreed, “it looks like that
now. But you can’t tell; it may be frozen tight
again by morning. Where are you going to get
your sails, Dick?”</p>

<p>“At the Cove. There’s a fellow there makes
them. And, say, you fellows, I’ve got to finish
this plan this afternoon so as to take it over to-morrow.
I don’t want to seem inhospitable, but
if you’ll just let me alone for about an hour I can
do it.”</p>

<p>“Of course we will,” Harry declared. “We’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
go right away. Come on, Vidocq, and Sherlock
Holmes!”</p>

<p>“You’re sure you don’t want me to stay and
help you?” asked Chub. “I’m a terror at planning;
once I planned a dog-house.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it was a peach!” jeered Roy.</p>

<p>“It was. I put a door at each end so Caesar
could get in and out easily, but the fool dog
thought it was a tunnel and used to run through
it full-tilt like an express train.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Fact, really! He’d get a good start and go
through like sixty; and he used to whistle as
he went in.”</p>

<p>“Chub Eaton!” cried Harry. “You come on
home after that!”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Chub. “This is no place
for genius, anyway. After you, Miss Estrella De
Vere.”</p>

<small>THE <i>BOREAS</i> TAKES THE ICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When Saturday came the four walked over
to the Cove through a blinding snow-storm
to view the ice-boat. Dick piloted them
down to the edge of the river, where, in a little
shed in Johnson’s Shipyard, were two timbers
bolted and braced together in the shape of a cross
which Dick declared was the ice-boat. The mast
was ready but not yet stepped and the narrow
oval at one end which Dick called a cockpit was
still unfinished. Harry was distinctly disappointed.</p>

<p>“I’d be afraid to sail on that, Dick,” she confided
earnestly. “I might tumble off.”</p>

<p>Roy and Chub, however, were enthusiastic over
the craft. The tapering backbone of shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
whitewood and the runner-plank of the same
material looked very business-like. Stays of steel
wire led from the runner-plank forward and back
to the ends of the backbone, with turn-buckles to
tighten them. The rigging also, Dick explained,
was to be of wire. The sails were promised for
the middle of the next week, and on the following
Saturday the boat was to be launched. On the
way back to school there was little opportunity
for conversation, since it was necessary to fight
against the wind and sleet at every step. But
afterward, before a roaring fire in the study room,
they discussed the matter of a name. Harry had
written down eleven names and Roy and Chub
had one or two to suggest besides. Harry’s suggestions,
much to her disappointment, didn’t find
favor. Such names as <i>Ice Queen</i>, <i>Reindeer</i> and
<i>Fleetwing</i> were, Dick thought, rather too ladylike,
as he expressed it.</p>

<p>“I’d thought of <i>Storm King</i>,” said Roy tentatively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not bad, but it doesn’t suggest speed,” Dick
said. “How would <i>Tempest</i> do?”</p>

<p>“<i>Tempest</i> sounds like rain,” Chub objected,
“with thunder and lightning on the side.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. What’s your name for it, Chub?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got just the thing,” answered Chub
modestly. “What do you say to <i>Polar Bear</i>?”</p>

<p>“Might as well call it <i>Teddy Bear</i>,” scoffed
Roy. “Polar bears aren’t fast.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they, though? Did you ever have one
chase you?”</p>

<p>“No, did you?”</p>

<p>“Lots,” answered Chub. “They can run like
sixty!”</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Harry, “polar bears aren’t
green, and the boat’s going to be green.”</p>

<p>“Polar bears are green before they’re boiled,”
said Chub flippantly. “And anyway the boat
isn’t painted yet. It could just as well be white
as green.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you name it <i>Dick</i>?” asked Roy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
“You’re about the fastest thing on the ice I know
of.”</p>

<p>“<i>Glacier?</i>” queried Chub.</p>

<p>“Icy, but slow,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“I know!” cried Harry. “<i>North Wind!</i>”</p>

<p>“That’s not bad, is it?” asked Dick. “Only I
suppose it’s been used dozens of times. I’ll put
that down, anyway. Try again, Harry.”</p>

<p>Harry settled her chin in the palm of one hand
and frowned intensely at the leaping flames.</p>

<p>“<i>Blast!</i>” exclaimed Chub. “You speak of an
icy blast, don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you’d think right away of dynamite,”
laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“I suppose you would if you had no more
poetry or romance in your soul than you have,
you wild Westerner!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there a bird that lives on ice?” asked
Harry suddenly.</p>

<p>“Never heard of one,” Roy laughed. “He’d
get cramps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mean that lives where there’s nothing but
ice, Smarty,” said Harry indignantly.</p>

<p>“Then he’d have to eat it, wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Quit your fooling,” said Chub. “Estrella De
Vere is in earnest. You are quite right, Harry.
The little bird you are thinking of is the ice-pick.
It makes its nest in refrigerators and lives on
lemon ice-cream and pineapple sherbet.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re all horrid,” said Harry.
“There is a bird, Dick, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“There’s the eider-duck,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>“Which plucks the feathers from its own breast
and makes them into eiderdown quilts,” added
Chub. “We will call the boat the <i>Eiderdown
Quilt</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out, Chub,” said Roy. “Talk sense,
can’t you?”</p>

<p>“You ask the impossible,” murmured Chub.</p>

<p>“Well, so far we’ve got only one worth considering,”
said Dick. “That’s <i>North Wind</i>. What
do you think of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sounds good to me,” said Chub.</p>

<p>“All right, I think,” Roy replied.</p>

<p>“Can’t think of anything better, any of you?”</p>

<p>Roy and Chub shook their heads.</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t have to decide on it yet,” said
Dick. “And maybe we’ll think of something else
before Saturday. I’m going up-stairs; any one
coming?”</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Harry. “I know!”</p>

<p>“Estrella De Vere has got an idea,” chanted
Chub.</p>

<p>“I know the very thing,” went on Harry with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Out with it,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“<i>Boreas!</i>”</p>

<p>The three boys looked at each other inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Boreas,” muttered Dick.</p>

<p>“Boreas,” echoed Roy.</p>

<p>“Boreas,” pondered Chub.</p>

<p>“That’s not half bad, is it?” asked Dick.
“Boreas was—was—who was he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was the north wind,” said Chub. “He’s
in mythology, you know.”</p>

<p>“I like it,” Roy declared. “It sounds sort of
blustery and cold and—and—”</p>

<p>“<i>Boreas</i> it is!” said Dick with decision. Chub
leaped up and seized Harry’s hand and shook it
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you,” he said earnestly. “You
have won the prize and won’t have to risk your
life on the boat!”</p>

<p>“But it’s a good name, isn’t it, Dick?” Harry
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Fine,” Dick replied. “I had a feeling all
along that you would be the one to find a name
for us.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” asked Chub
indignantly. “I could have suggested Boreas
long ago, only I wanted to give Harry a chance to
save her life.”</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got a name,” said Roy, “all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
remains is to get the boat. I wish it was next
Saturday now, Dick.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” Chub chimed in. “Three cheers for
the <i>Boreas</i>!”</p>

<p>Just a week later the <i>Boreas</i> took the water—I
should say ice. <a href="#image13">The launching</a> was not a ceremonious
affair, nor was it largely attended.
There were present that Saturday morning Dick,
Chub, the builder, four small boys and the
builder’s assistant. I mention them in the order
of their apparent importance. The <i>Boreas</i>, resplendent
in new dark green paint, was awaiting
the ceremony on the edge of the ice, varnished
spars shining in the sunlight, creamy sails furled
on the booms and the wire rigging gleaming like
silver strands.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232-<br />233]</a></span></p>

<p>There may be some of my readers who have
never met with a real live ice-boat, and for
their benefit a few words about the craft in general
may not be out of place. The plan of an ice-boat
is practically a triangle, the stern being the
apex and each angle terminating in a steel runner.
The runner at the apex or stern is movable and
does duty as a rudder. But what might be called
the deck plan of an ice-boat shows an elongated
lozenge enclosing a cross. The cross is formed by
the fore-and-aft timber, called the backbone, and
the transverse timber called the runner-plank.
At the ends of the latter are attached the fixed
runners, and from a point near-by wire braces run
forward to the bow end of the backbone and aft to
the stern, forming the outline of the lozenge. At
the extreme end of the backbone is the steering-box,
which corresponds to the cockpit of a water
craft. This is usually shaped like a flattened oval,
cushioned or carpeted and is large enough to hold
two persons, one on each side of the backbone.
The mast is set forward of the intersection of the
two timbers.</p>

<p>There are two popular styles of rig: the jib and
mainsail—like a sloop—and the lateen, a single
sail triangular in shape. But whatever rig is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
used, the effort is made to have the center of
weight as low as possible, and to this end the sails
are made broad and low as compared with the
sails on water boats. By lowering the center of
weight the danger of capsizing is lessened.</p>

<p>The <i>Boreas</i> was rigged with jib and mainsail.
Doubtless experienced ice-yachtsmen would have
found much to criticize. Even Dick acknowledged
that the mast was far too short and the sail
area much less than it should have been. Also
there were awkward points of construction resulting
from lack of knowledge. But Dick was very
well satisfied for all that, and Mr. Johnson
viewed the result of his labor with pride. The
ceremonies attending the launching—which was
really no launching at all, since the boat was on
the ice when the boys arrived at the scene—were
short and simple. Dick handed a check to the
builder—a rather good-sized check it was, too—and
Chub, striking an attitude, cried: “I christen
you <i>Boreas</i>!” As Chub said, there wasn’t any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
bow in sight and so it would have been idle to have
brought even a bottle of root beer along with
them.</p>

<p>Dick unlashed the sails and hoisted them one
after the other. They looked very fine in the sunlight
and he ran his eye over their expanse of
creamy whiteness with admiration. Then he and
the builder turned their attention to the mooring
line, and Chub, curled up in the steering-box with
his hand on the tiller, sang “Mister Johnson, turn
me loose!” And a moment later they were gliding
gently away from the shore with the runners singing
softly as they slid over the hard ice. Dick
took the tiller and the boat’s head turned up-stream.
They waved a good-by to the figures on
the shore, and none too soon, for the gleaming
sails caught the wind fairly and the <i>Boreas</i> began
to gain speed every moment.</p>

<p>“Say, can’t she go?” asked Chub, watching the
shore go by with amazement.</p>

<p>“She seems all right, doesn’t she?” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Dick. “But she isn’t really going now. The
wind’s dead astern.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s pretty good for a starter,” answered
Chub. “A fellow feels a little bit uneasy
just at first, eh?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s sort of funny, and that’s a fact,”
owned Dick. “And until I’ve learned a little
more about the thing I’m not taking any chances.
There are several tricks I want to try.”</p>

<p>“How fast do you suppose we’re going?”
asked Chub. Dick shook his head.</p>

<p>“Blest if I know. I was never on one before.
We’ll call it fifteen miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“Bet you it’s nearer thirty!” said Chub.</p>

<p>“When you go that fast you’ll know it,” Dick
answered grimly. “Hold fast now; I’m going to
tack her a bit.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we’re going fast enough
as—” began Chub.</p>

<p>But the inquiry ended in an exclamation of
alarm as one runner lifted itself off the ice and the
boat heeled over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that safe?” asked Chub anxiously.</p>

<p>“Sure; two runners are enough any day,” Dick
shouted back.</p>

<p>But he eased up on the helm and the boat settled
back again, and Chub gave vent to a sigh of relief.
Dick looked over and smiled.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Chub apologetically, “I kind
of like to keep in touch with things.”</p>

<p>“Watch out for Thurston’s boat,” said Dick.
“If we come across her we’ll sort of get a line on
our sailing ability maybe.”</p>

<p>“Don’t see anything of her,” answered Chub,
“but my eyes are watering so I can’t see much of
anything. What’s that over there across the
river?” Dick turned to look.</p>

<p>“Coleville,” he answered.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Chub. “Already? Why, we
haven’t been going a minute! Talk about your
automobiles!”</p>

<p>News of the ice-boat had got out days before,
and when the <i>Boreas</i> drew near to the landing at
Ferry Hill most of the school was on hand to welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
it. For a first attempt Dick’s handling of
the craft as he swung it around and ran it nose
into the wind beside the landing was very creditable.
Dozens of eager hands aided to hold the
boat and numerous voices were raised in petition.</p>

<p>“Let me go with you, Somes?”</p>

<p>“You promised me, Dick! Don’t forget!”</p>

<p>“I’m going, ain’t I, Dick? Just for a minute,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother him! He can’t take every one,
can you, Dick? He’s going to take me this time
and then the rest of you fellows will have your
chance.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to take any one this time,”
answered Dick. “I’m going to get the hang of
her and maybe I’ll turn her over. And I don’t
want any fellow to get hurt. I’ll give every one a
ride when I get around to it. Shove her bow off a
bit, will you, Chub?”</p>

<p>Chub, who had disembarked not altogether unwillingly,
obeyed and the <i>Boreas</i> darted away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
from the shore with Dick lying low in the steering-box.
For the next half-hour he put the boat
through her paces, while the group on shore
watched. He had read everything he could find
on the subject of ice-yachting and there were
many things he wanted to settle to his own satisfaction.
One of them was the fact that an ice-boat
will go faster across the wind than with it. Dick
was no sailor and at first the proposition had
struck him as a bit startling. “Many persons,”
said his authority, “fancy that a yacht goes faster
before the wind than in any other direction, but
this is not necessarily so. If the wind is blowing
at a velocity of ten miles an hour, the yacht cannot
possibly make more than that amount of speed.
In other words, the boat can travel no faster than
the wind itself. If it did the sails would be aback
instead of drawing. It is on what yachtsmen call
a ‘reach’—that is, with the wind on the quarter or
the beam—that a yacht may sail faster than the
wind is blowing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick proved this very speedily, for the <i>Boreas</i>,
while she slid along very well with the wind behind,
instantly increased her speed when she was
sent on a tack. He also discovered among other
things that it was extremely unwise to move the
tiller abruptly when the boat was going fast. He
tried it once and only saved himself from taking
a flying leap across the ice by the veriest miracle.
But it was vastly exhilarating, even in the little
eight-mile breeze which was blowing up the river,
and when the boat was on a leeward reach with
the windward runner high off the ice and the runner-plank
slanting up at a good angle, the sensation
he received was as near like that of flying as
anything could be, he thought.</p>

<p>He made up his mind that the next time he ventured
out he would be more warmly dressed, for
the wind drove right through his sweater, and his
hands under his woolen gloves felt like pieces of
ice. When, at last, he headed back down the river
on a broad tack for the landing he was quite ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to exchange the steering-box of the <i>Boreas</i> for a
place in front of the fireplace in the study-room.
Willing hands helped him pull the boat up on the
bank and furl the sails. Then, with Harry and
Roy and Chub as immediate body-guard, he set
off up the hill toward the dormitory and dinner.
To the latter he brought a most appreciative appetite.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Roy had his first trip, and
later, when he had been safely returned to the rink
for the hockey game, Chub took his place. The
<i>Boreas</i> spun up the river for some fifteen miles
and by the time the cruise was over Chub had
got over his nervousness and was as enthusiastic
an ice-yachtsman as ever wept in the teeth of a
gale.</p>

<small>THE DOCTOR INTERVENES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">I am sorry to say that for something like a
fortnight past Dick’s lessons had been suffering.
He didn’t really intend that they should,
but when one is studying the science of ice-yachting
and at the same time superintending the
building of a boat, one is likely to be pretty busy;
and that was the case with Dick. There wasn’t
time for ice-boat and lessons, too, and so he made
the mistake of sacrificing the lessons. And very
soon he wished he hadn’t.</p>

<p>The weather held clear and bitterly cold, and on
Monday the <i>Boreas</i> was once more flying up and
down the river. There was a light breeze, but
enough to make the boat show plenty of speed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
leeward. Harry had her first sail that afternoon
and enjoyed it immensely. Dick was careful to
run no risk of capsizing and kept a safe distance
from rough ice. They ran down to Silver Cove in
a series of long reaches and then came back up
the river before the wind. Off Coleville they
sighted Joe Thurston’s boat, but its skipper refused
to come out and try conclusions, although
the <i>Boreas</i> hovered tantalizingly about for some
time. The red boat hugged the shore closely and
finally snuggled up against the Hammond landing
and dropped her sails. Although Dick was
anxious to race he was not altogether sorry to
have the opportunity deferred, for with Harry
aboard he would not have wanted to let the <i>Boreas</i>
out to full speed. But he made up his mind
that to-morrow afternoon he would run over to
Coleville and make Thurston race with him. But
there’s never any knowing what twenty-four
hours will bring forth.</p>

<p>At breakfast the next morning Dick’s name was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
among those mentioned by the Doctor and Dick
was one of a half dozen boys required to pay visits
to the Doctor’s office at noon. Dick went out
of the dining hall feeling rather uneasy and wishing
that he had given more attention to his studies
of late. Roy and Chub captured him outside and
decoyed him into the study room. They were
both looking preternaturally solemn, and Chub
insisted on wringing his hand silently.</p>

<p>“Of course you can come back next year,” said
Roy. “It isn’t likely he will fire you for good.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Chub. “Might as well look
on the bright side of it. And if you try you can
study at home enough to keep up with your class.
Of course there’s the disgrace of it, but—well,
you can live that down in time.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can,” Roy assured him, evidently
striving to be cheerful in the face of adversity.
“But we’ll miss you, Dick, like anything.”</p>

<p>“You bet we will,” Chub said. “And—er—you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
won’t want to take the ice-boat home with
you, I suppose. So I’ll take charge of it for you,
old man.”</p>

<p>“We both will,” added Roy. “Anything to
oblige a friend.”</p>

<p>Dick listened with a sheepish smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” he said, “and have a good time.
I don’t mind. Children must be amused.”</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t let it harden you,” pleaded Chub.
“Face it like a man and live it down. After all,
there are worse things in life—”</p>

<p>But Dick’s patience was at an end and Chub’s
philosophizing was cut short by the sudden necessity
of defending himself against Dick’s onslaught.
A minute later Mr. Cobb, passing
through the corridor, put his head in at the door
long enough to remark:</p>

<p>“Boys! No fooling in the study room, remember!”</p>

<p>The three disentangled themselves, panting and
puffing, and proceeded to repair their attire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Chub, with one end of his collar pointing toward
his ear, observed the torn button-hole out of the
corner of his eye and turned severely to Dick.</p>

<p>“I just hope he does fire you, you big Western
brute! Look what you’ve done to my collar.”</p>

<p>“Go and borrow one of Sid’s,” suggested Roy
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re even,” Dick answered unruffledly.
“My suspenders are busted.”</p>

<p>After the final morning recitation Dick turned
his steps toward the office. Of course there was
no question of being expelled, but nevertheless he
was anxious to know what awaited him. There
were two boys ahead of him and he had to wait
in the library for almost half an hour, and, naturally
enough, that wasn’t pleasant. But finally
the suspense ended and he found himself facing
the Doctor.</p>

<p>“Somes, I hear from Mr. Buckman and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Cobb that you have been doing very poorly in
your studies of late, and my own observations
bear out their report. What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>Dick was silent, searching for a reply that
would be at once truthful and not too self-incriminating.</p>

<p>“Maybe we made a mistake in putting you in
the Second Senior Class. I was in doubt about
the advisability of it at the time, you will remember.
Perhaps you had better drop back a class.
Does that appeal to you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” Dick answered with emphasis.</p>

<p>“But if the lessons are too hard for you?”</p>

<p>“They’re not, sir.”</p>

<p>“They’re not? Well, that’s a refreshing thing
to hear, Somes. I’ve just been talking to several
other boys and had begun to think that we were
driving the students too hard here. Then you
don’t find the lessons too difficult?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then may I ask again what the trouble is?
If they are not too difficult why can’t you learn
them?”</p>

<p>“I can, sir,” answered Dick after a moment’s
pause. “I—haven’t been studying very hard
lately. I’m sorry, sir.”</p>

<p>“So am I. Because you are wasting your time,
and you are wasting our time. When you came
here you told me that you would abide by the
rules and be diligent. Didn’t you, Somes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And you haven’t been doing it.
For some two weeks or so you have been coming
into class with your lessons half prepared. You
haven’t kept your part of the agreement, my boy.
Supposing I were to tell you that an agreement
broken by one of the parties becomes void? You
realize what that would mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Dick troubledly.</p>

<p>There followed a moment of silence during
which the Doctor, leaning back in his chair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
rolling his pen between his fingers, studied Dick
attentively. Then:</p>

<p>“I believe you have lately bought some sort of
an ice-boat, Somes. Is that correct?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I got it Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Hum! Rather an expensive luxury for a boy
of your age, it seems to me. Do you think that
your father would approve of your buying it if
he knew?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He lets me buy what I like.”</p>

<p>“I see. How long have you been negotiating
for this boat?”</p>

<p>“I—I ordered it about two weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“Rather a coincidence that, don’t you think,
Somes? It looks to me as though that ice-boat
explained matters. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘Yes, sir’?”</p>

<p>“I guess it does explain. I was so—so busy
thinking about it, sir, that I didn’t have time to
study much,” answered Dick honestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you sailed it yet?”</p>

<p>“I was out Saturday and yesterday, sir.”</p>

<p>“Like it, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, very much.”</p>

<p>The Doctor was silent a moment. Then, smiling
slightly, he asked:</p>

<p>“Do you know what I am considering, Somes?”</p>

<p>“I think so, sir. You’re going to take the boat
away, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. I couldn’t absolutely take it
away from you, for it is, of course, your property.
But I could forbid you to use it while at my
school. You understand that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, what I am going to do is to forbid you
to use it again until you have caught up with
your lessons. How long that will be depends on
you. Does that sound unjust to you?”</p>

<p>Dick studied his hands attentively.</p>

<p>“Recollect, please, that you came here first of
all to study, to work. A certain amount of play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
is very necessary, but when play interferes with
work it is time to call a halt. That appears to be
what has happened in your case, Somes. You
have allowed yourself to get far behind in your
lessons. It can’t go on, you know. You’ve got
to turn over a new leaf if you want to stay here
at Ferry Hill. You acknowledged yourself that
you can learn your lessons, and so I must insist
that you do so. This ice-boat seems to have
proved a disturbing element. So I propose to
eliminate it for a while, until, in fact, you have
shown that you mean to keep your part of our
agreement. Do you think I am unjust?”</p>

<p>Dick gave over examining his hands and looked
at the Doctor.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he answered. “I guess you’re—pretty
white.”</p>

<p>The Doctor bent his head to conceal the smile
that trembled about his mouth. Then:</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the way it stands then. Catch
up with your studies and you can go back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
ice-boat. But until then—leave it strictly alone
and try to forget about it. That’s all, I think.
Good morning, Somes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. Good morning.”</p>

<p>Dick found Chub after dinner and pulled him
into a corner of the corridor.</p>

<p>“Easy now,” Chub protested. “This is the
last clean collar I’ve got!”</p>

<p>“Never mind your collar,” said Dick. “What
I want you to do is to sail the <i>Boreas</i> down to
Johnson’s this afternoon and tell him to look
after her for me until I call. Do you think you
can do it?”</p>

<p>“Sail it? Of course I can,” said Chub. “But
what—what’s the matter? Has the Doctor been
acting up?”</p>

<p>Dick told what had passed in the office, and at
four o’clock Chub and the <i>Boreas</i> passed down
the river. Dick, from the study room window,
watched them go and then turned with a sigh to
his books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the next week or so Dick studied desperately;
even Roy and Chub, who knew what he was capable
of in the way of concentration, were surprised
at the zeal he displayed. All their efforts to entice
him out of the library or the study room in
the afternoons went for naught and in the end
they were invariably forced to take their departure
without him, leaving him alone in his glory
and often to the undisputed possession of the
room. Day after day of bright, cold weather
came and passed, days with crisp winds which
would have brought joy to the heart of the ice-yachtsman.
Harry was very indignant at her
father’s action and confided to Roy and Chub
that she had scolded him severely.</p>

<p>“I guess he felt pretty much ashamed of himself,”
laughed Roy. “Is he going to apologize
to Dick?”</p>

<p>“N—no, he was very unreasonable,” answered
Harry. “He said he guessed things would have
to stand the way they were.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll have to manage him better than that,”
Roy said with a shake of his head. “Your authority
is in danger, Harry.”</p>

<p>Saturday evening Dick took a brief vacation
from study and there was a meeting of the F. H.
S. I. S. in the barn. But nothing was accomplished,
although ways and means were discussed
for some time and all sorts of schemes for raising
the money were advanced.</p>

<p>“If only Ferry Hill had turned out a few dozen
millionaires,” mourned Chub. “Every school
ought to graduate a millionaire a year.”</p>

<p>“Maybe some of the Ferry Hill grads are millionaires,”
said Dick thoughtfully. “If we only
had a list of them we might be able to find out.”</p>

<p>“I thought millionaires didn’t go to school,”
said Harry. “They’re self-made, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“They always used to be,” Roy replied, “but
I guess the new crop is different.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re degenerating,” Chub added.
“It’s the same way with Presidents. It used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
be that you couldn’t be President unless you had
been a poor boy and had worked on a farm. But
look at the Presidents nowadays! Just ordinary
rich men! Why, most anybody can be President
now!”</p>

<p>“There’s a chance for you, Chub,” suggested
Roy. “You never split a rail in your life.”</p>

<p>“And I’m sure he never studied by the light of
a log-fire,” laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“I think it’s beautiful about Abraham Lincoln,”
said Harry wistfully. “I wish I had been
born a poor boy so I could have done the way he
did and been President of the United States, and
had a birthday after I was dead, with flags and
speeches and—and things!”</p>

<p>“I suppose if you were President,” said Chub,
“you’d make Methuselah Secretary of State,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you could be Secretary of the Navy,
and Dick, Secretary of War, and Roy—”</p>

<p>“Secretary of Agriculture,” Dick suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I’d make him my private secretary.”</p>

<p>“Roy always does have all the luck,” grieved
Chub. “I’m mad; I resign from the cabinet!”</p>

<p>And with Chub’s resignation the meeting broke
up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Wednesday Dick had made up his lost studies
and the embargo on the <i>Boreas</i> was removed.
And on the same day Harry sought him with tidings
of a challenge from Joe Thurston.</p>

<p>“He told Grace—that’s his sister, you know—to
tell me to tell you that he wanted to race you
with his ice-boat. Its name is the <i>Snowbird</i>.
Isn’t that a pretty name, Dick? And he wants
to race to-morrow after school, and says he will
meet you at the landing here at half-past three.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t get the <i>Boreas</i> up here by that
time,” said Dick, “unless—” he paused and
thought a moment. Then, “All right,” he said.
“You tell his sister that I’ll be there, Harry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“But how can you get the boat?” she asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll go down in the morning before breakfast,”
he answered. “Mr. Cobb will give me permission
all right. Did he say how far he wanted
to race?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Harry. “And, Dick, I suppose I
couldn’t go with you, could I? I’d like to awfully.”
But Dick shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’d be afraid to have you,” he answered. “I
guess I’d better go alone; unless Thurston takes
some one with him; if he does I’ll get Chub
to go with me. You couldn’t kill Chub if you
tried.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can beat the <i>Snowbird</i>?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess the north wind is faster than
any old bird ever made,” laughed Dick. “But
Thurston knows a heap more about sailing than
I do, I suppose, and that ought to help him a lot.
But I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“And, Dick, you must have a Ferry Hill flag
on the mast!”</p>

<p>“That’s so, but I’ll have to borrow one somewhere.
I don’t own one.”</p>

<p>“You shall have mine,” cried Harry. “It’s a
lucky flag, Dick, and if you have it you just can’t
help winning the race!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE RACE OF THE ICE-BOATS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A bitterly cold, lowering day with a
northeasterly gale blowing almost straight
down the river, nipping fingers and ears and
noses. Now and then a fitful flurry of snow, driving
past like a miniature blizzard.</p>

<p>In front of the Ferry Hill landing two ice-boats,
heads to the wind, sails snapping and wire rigging
singing in the blasts; one with red hull and
a cherry-and-black flag whipping from the masthead,
the other glistening in new green and bearing
the brown-and-white banner of Ferry Hill on
high. About them some sixty boys from the rival
schools, turning and twisting in and out on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
skates in an effort to keep warm in the face of
the biting gale. And over all a leaden, cheerless
sky.</p>

<p>The race was to be windward and return, a distance
of about fourteen miles. The starting-line
was opposite the northern end of the boat-house,
the turning-point some seven miles up the river
at a place called Indian Head, where a small islet
rose from the river near the west bank to serve
as a mark. The boats were to finish opposite the
boat-house. On the <i>Snowbird</i> were Joe Thurston
and his friend Bob Cutler, while the <i>Boreas</i> held
Dick and Chub. Whitcomb, with a small starting
pistol in his gloved hand, was trying to push the
crowd back so that the boats might swing into the
wind at the signal.</p>

<p>The warning was given, the rival skippers declared
themselves ready and the pistol barked, its
sharp report being instantly whisked away on the
wind. The slender noses of the two boats were
turned, the sails filled slowly, and after a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of seeming hesitation the <i>Snowbird</i> and the <i>Boreas</i>
started slowly across the ice on the first tack
to starboard, while behind them the rival groups
shouted encouragement to the yachtsmen and defiance
to each other. With every instant the boats
gathered headway, gliding across the glassy
surface like gaily hued dragon-flies above the surface
of a pool. The white wings became taut
under the steady wind and the windward runners
left the ice as the boats heeled further and further.
It was nip and tuck on that first tack, the
boats keeping their relative positions until the
farther shore was reached and the helms were
put over. Around swung the crafts and pointed
their noses toward the right bank of the river.</p>

<p>On the <i>Boreas</i> Dick and Chub lay on opposite
sides of the backbone which divided the steering-box
into halves. Dick held the tiller. They were
wrapped in the warmest clothing they had been
able to find, but it was far from warm enough.
The wind came slanting against them and bored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
its way down necks and up sleeves. Fingers were
already tingling and foreheads aching.</p>

<p>“Cold!” shouted Dick above the singing of the
runners and the whistle of the wind. Chub nodded
and made a grimace without taking his gaze
from the <i>Snowbird</i>, which, some fifty feet away,
was bowling along finely.</p>

<p>“She’s gaining,” said Chub presently. Dick
turned and looked, glanced at his sails and eased
the helm a little. Then it was time to go about
again, since the shore was becoming dangerously
near. The <i>Snowbird</i> was already turning, slowing
for a moment as she pointed dead to windward
and then springing away again as the gale
slanted across the sails. The <i>Boreas</i> had lost and
on this tack she was sixty or seventy yards behind
her rival. The latter’s larger sail area was telling.
Chub looked anxiously at Dick, but that
youth was gazing across at the <i>Snowbird</i>, a hand
held in front of his face to break the wind. When
he turned there was a little frown on his face and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
he pointed the nose of the <i>Boreas</i> closer into the
wind. For a while she seemed to be holding her
own. Then the <i>Snowbird</i> went about again, this
time on a mile-long reach made possible by a bend
in the river. The <i>Boreas</i> was almost half a minute
behind now and Dick was growling things to
himself that Chub couldn’t catch. The wind
seemed to be growing stronger, though perhaps
it was merely that it had a broader sweep here
where the stream turned toward the east.</p>

<p>“How fast?” asked Chub, his hand to his
mouth.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five, I guess,” Dick shouted back.</p>

<p>Chub tried to whistle, but couldn’t. Beside
them the ice was only a blurred surface that
rushed by without form or substance, a grayish-green
nothing, as it seemed, above which they
were speeding with a rapidity that almost took
the breath away. The wind shrieked and roared
and strove to blow them from the box to which
they were clinging. A sudden flurry of snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
rushed down upon them, hiding the shore and the
other boat from their sight, and blinding them so
that for a moment they had to close their eyes.</p>

<p>“Look out for the shore!” cried Chub, with a
gasp. There was an unintelligible word from
Dick in reply as a gray shape suddenly sprang
out of the snow-mist. “Hold hard!” he shouted.
Chub had just time to obey when over went the
tiller, there was a loud <em>slur—r—r</em> as the runners
ground sideways against the ice and the <i>Boreas</i>
threw herself about so suddenly that it was all
the boys could do to keep their places. Then a
quick leap forward and the boat was on the other
tack and the snow-squall had passed. They looked
eagerly for the <i>Snowbird</i>. She had gained some,
but not much. The <i>Boreas</i> with a rush and a roar
swept after her. It was a short tack this time,
since Hopple Rock lay dead ahead off the west
shore, and soon they were once more on the port
tack, the windward end of the runner-plank standing
high above the ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s the Head!” said Dick.</p>

<p>Perhaps two miles up the frozen river a somber
rock, tree crowned, arose from the gray ice like a
rugged sugar-loaf. There was no mistaking it,
although neither Dick nor Chub had ever journeyed
so far up-stream. The boats must pass
around it before they turned homeward. Dick, as
best he could, shading his eyes with one mittened
hand, studied the river. Then he moved the tiller
slowly and cautiously until the boat was heeled
so far over that Chub was forced to cling frantically
to the backbone to keep from rolling off onto
the ice. But the boat responded with increased
speed. Chub, with the tears streaming from his
eyes, held on, at once fearful and fascinated.
Surely they were flying through air and that
grayness flowing swiftly beneath them was cloud!
It was hard to believe that they were on solid ice!</p>

<p>“Hold tight!” cried Dick.</p>

<p>Chub wondered how he could hold any tighter
with his numbed and aching fingers. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
windward runner dropped quickly to the ice, the
<i>Boreas</i> swung about on her heel and Chub found
himself rolling over against the backbone as the
new tack began. Half a mile ahead the <i>Snowbird</i>,
a low streak of red topped with a snowy
spread of sail, was crossing in the opposite direction,
the cherry-and-black flag at the masthead
standing out as stiff as though starched.</p>

<p>“She’s got us beaten!” said Chub.</p>

<p>But Dick made no answer. He was calculating
his chances. It was evident that the <i>Snowbird</i>
was going to round the rock on the starboard
tack. That meant, as Dick figured it out, that she
would make two more reaches first. But to Dick
it seemed that perhaps something was to be
gained by hauling closer to the wind at the next
turn and making a long tack to port until a point
was reached near the east shore and slightly below
the rock. From there he could round the
mark with a short tack to starboard and start
home on a long course with the wind abeam. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
meant allowing the <i>Snowbird</i> to gain now in the
hope of cutting down her lead later. So when the
<i>Boreas</i> again came about Chub found that it was
not necessary to hold on for dear life. The boat
was headed closer into the wind and the steering-box
was no longer canted at an alarming angle.
The speed was less, but the boat demonstrated the
fact that she could do fast work when close-hauled.
The <i>Snowbird</i> crossed twice ahead of
them during the next few minutes and finally, just
as the <i>Boreas</i> was nearing the end of her final
reach to port, she shot from around the island
and turned homeward. Chub looked anxious and
perplexed. Then over went the helm once more,
there was a sharp swirl as the <i>Boreas</i> swung
about and the black rock rushed toward them.
As they skirted it the starboard runner was
scarcely more than six yards from the gray boulders
that lay about it. Then the wind was behind
them and with a rush and a bound the <i>Boreas</i>
started toward home. The <i>Snowbird</i> was, as Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
estimated, three quarters of a mile ahead, running
fleetly on the opposite tack.</p>

<p>A stern chase is a long chase, they say, and the
crew of the <i>Boreas</i> found it so. And yet, before
half the distance to the finish had been reeled off,
they knew that they were gaining slowly but consistently
on their opponent. Joe Thurston was
making the mistake of sailing too closely before
the wind. Dick, on the other hand, strove to keep
the wind well on his beam, and while, in order to
do this, it was necessary to put the <i>Boreas</i> on
shorter tacks, the result was warranting it. Little
by little the green boat cut down the distance
that separated her from the red. But with three
miles still to run it seemed that the handicap was
too large. The <i>Snowbird</i> looked then very much
like a winner to Chub and he wondered how
Harry would reconcile the defeat of the <i>Boreas</i>
with the fact that her lucky Ferry Hill banner
was flying from the masthead. If the boats had
made speed going up the river they were simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
flying now, although as the wind was behind them
the difference was not very appreciable to the
boys. Thirty miles an hour when you are scarcely
a foot above the surface seems a terrific pace.</p>

<p>Two miles above Ferry Hill the <i>Snowbird</i> was
scarcely a quarter of a mile ahead. She was
starting on a long reach which, if all went well
with her, would be the last but one to bring her to
the line. The <i>Boreas</i> was on the opposite side of
the river and as she swung across on a new tack
it was evident that Dick was ready for any hazard.
Chub found himself in danger of rolling off
onto the ice, while Dick seemed every moment
about to topple down upon him. The <i>Boreas</i> was
like a boy standing on one leg and kicking the
other into the air. Then another change of course
and it was Chub’s turn to go up. There were
moments when he vowed that if he reached home
safely he would never trust himself again on an
ice-boat with Dick Somes. But they were gaining
every moment now and the quarter-mile lead was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
down to an eighth. Suddenly Chub, who was
peering ahead at the <i>Snowbird</i>, gave an exclamation
of surprise. The <i>Snowbird</i>, then in mid-stream,
had suddenly left her tack and had headed
again toward the east shore.</p>

<p>“Ice-crack!” shouted Dick in explanation. “I
saw it when we came up.”</p>

<p>“Better change your course then,” said Chub
anxiously. But Dick only shook his head. That
the <i>Snowbird</i> had decided to go around it and so
give him a good chance of winning was no reason
why he should follow suit. The <i>Boreas</i> held her
course. Chub glanced in alarm at the calm, set
face beside him and something he saw there
quieted his fears. He looked forward. Ahead,
rushing toward them, was a black fissure, an ice-crack
which extended for over a hundred yards
almost directly across the ice. How wide it was
Chub had no idea. Nor did he have time for
much speculation, for:</p>

<p>“<em>Hold for all you’re worth, Chub!</em>” cried Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272-<br />273]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a twelve-foot expanse of water and
broken ice swept up to them, Dick eased the helm
until the boat was at right angles to the crack and
the fore runners struck the slightly raised edge
of the fissure at the same instant. Chub closed
his eyes and held on convulsively. The <i>Boreas</i>
rose bodily in the air, there was a momentary
sensation of being swept through space, and then
the runners clanged down upon the ice with a soft
jar and the <i>Boreas</i> was tearing along toward the
finish, having taken the gap with a twenty-foot
leap as a hunter takes a fence!</p>

<p>Chub opened his eyes. The crack was just a
dark thread behind them. Near at hand the
<i>Snowbird</i> was charging along with them neck and
neck. <a href="#image14">A half-mile away was the finish line</a> and
the groups of dark figures.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Dick again. And this time
there was exultation in his voice. The <i>Boreas</i>
heeled to the blast and drew away from the red
boat, foot by foot, yard by yard. Twenty seconds—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
there was a gap between them! Thirty
seconds—and there stretched the length of a boat
between! Forty seconds—and the <i>Boreas</i> was
charging past the waving figures at the finish, the
brown-and-white flag at the masthead flapping in
triumph. Dick had won by a scant ten yards!</p>

<small>FORMING THE TRACK TEAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">As though resolved that the <i>Boreas</i> should
rest for a while on her laurels, the weather
changed that night within the hour and when
morning dawned there was a warm southwest
wind blowing up the river. That afternoon Dick
took Harry for a sail, but the wind by that time
had died down to a thin, warm breeze that
scarcely filled the sails, and in consequence the
trip was not an exhilarating one. But exhilarating
or otherwise, it proved to be practically
the last of the season, for the warm weather held
until the ice-cracks, air-holes and expanses of rotten
ice which quickly developed made ice-boating
at once dangerous and unpleasant. To be sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
there were occasional trips, but the river never
returned to a state making possible another race
between the <i>Boreas</i> and the <i>Snowbird</i>, a race
which Joe Thurston was eager for and which Dick
was not at all averse to. Finally the <i>Boreas</i> was
drawn up beside the landing and dismantled, the
sails and rigging being stored in the boat-house.
As Chub poetically phrased it, “The career of the
good ship <i>Boreas</i> has been brief, but ah, how glorious!”</p>

<p>February was a fortnight old when the school
was thrown into a fever of mild excitement by a
notice posted on the bulletin board in School Hall.
The notice read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is proposed to form a Track Team, and a meeting
for that purpose will be held to-morrow (Friday) afternoon
in the Gym at 4:15. All fellows are earnestly requested
to be present.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Roy Porter</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">T. H. Eaton</span>.<br /></p>
</div>

<p>I think you could have formed most anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
at Ferry Hill just then, from a Croquet Club to a
Sewing Society. February is a dull time of year,
and the fellows were eager for anything which
promised to supply a new interest. For two
weeks the rink had been unfit to play on, and the
river in scarcely better condition. Ferry Hill had
won the first six games of its hockey schedule,
including the first contest with Hammond. The
second game with the rival school had been twice
postponed, and Roy was beginning to lose hope of
ever being able to play it, a thing which disgusted
him not a little since the team had shown itself to
be an unusually good one and able, in his and the
school’s estimation, to cope successfully with any
hockey team in the vicinity. With skating and
hockey at a standstill, base-ball practice confined
only to light work in the cage, and the golf links
still half a foot deep in snow, the forty-three students
at Ferry Hill were ripe for any excitement.
And as a result the meeting on Friday afternoon
was about as well attended as it could possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
have been. Things went with a rush from the
start. Roy outlined the project and introduced
Dick Somes, who had hitherto remained in the
background. It didn’t take Dick more than two
minutes of talking to have every fellow on the
edge of his chair with roseate visions of a track
and field victory over Hammond floating before
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Say, Roy,” whispered Chub, “Dick’s father
is some sort of a promoter, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so; sells mines, doesn’t he?
Why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much, only I know now where Dick
gets it!”</p>

<p>Before the meeting was over thirty-seven out
of thirty-nine fellows in attendance had put their
names down for the track team and had agreed
to contribute two dollars apiece. And there
wasn’t one of them who wasn’t firmly convinced
that he had the making of a sprinter, distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
runner, hurdler, jumper, pole-vaulter or weight-thrower!</p>

<p>“I’ve talked with Mr. Cobb,” said Dick, “and
he’s right with us in this; says there’s no reason
why we shouldn’t be able to turn out a dandy
team. Of course, we mustn’t set our hearts on
too much this spring; we’re new at it yet, and it
takes a couple of years to get the stride. But I
can’t see why we haven’t as good a chance to lick
Hammond as she has to lick us. (<em>Enthusiastic
applause.</em>) As soon as we’ve elected officers
we’ll get a challenge off to her, and I guess
there’s no doubt but what she’ll be glad to meet
us. We haven’t got a very good outdoor track
just now, but we’re going to fix that in time.
Meanwhile we can do a whole lot of work indoors,
and Mr. Cobb will arrange it so that he will be on
hand here three afternoons a week to give instruction.
But there mustn’t be any backing
down, fellows. If you go in to this you must keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
it up. It may seem like hard work at first, but
after we get out of doors you’ll like it immensely.
I’m not afraid of your backing out then; only that
you may get discouraged before that. But if
you’ll just remember all the time that we’re
going to show Hammond that we’re just as good
on the cinder track as we are on the gridiron and
the diamond and the river, why, I guess you’ll
stick it out.”</p>

<p>Dick sat down amid hearty cheers and Roy
proposed the election of officers.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he said, “that we’d better leave
the selection of a captain until a little later, until
we’ve been together a while and have seen who’s
capable of heading the team. So that leaves us
the duty of selecting a manager and assistant
manager. Nominations are in order.”</p>

<p>Warren proposed Roy for manager, but Roy
declined, pleading a press of other duties. Then
Chub, who had his instructions, arose and nominated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Dick. Dick was unanimously chosen. The
position of assistant manager was not so quickly
filled, but finally Sid Welch was put up and the
meeting accepted him hilariously, demanding a
speech. But Sid refused to make any remarks
except to bob his head and mutter something
about being much obliged.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon the candidates got to
work in the gymnasium. A less optimistic person
than Dick Somes would, I think, have been
rather discouraged by the prospect. Few of the
candidates for the team had ever seriously tried
the work which they had selected. A good many
of them, in fact, had very hazy ideas of what they
had let themselves in for, and there was a deal of
grumbling over chest-weights and dumb-bells.
But the grumbling always ceased when Dick drew
near, and his enthusiasm was contagious. Mr.
Cobb shook his head afterward and said he was
afraid there wasn’t enough material there to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
make a team that could hope to make a showing
against Hammond. But Dick wouldn’t listen to
that.</p>

<p>“We may be weak in some events,” he said,
“but we’ll have some good sprinters, you mark
my words, sir, and if we can get a lot of second
and third places we’ll make a good showing for a
new team. I wish every other fellow wouldn’t
insist on being either a hurdler or a hammer-thrower,
though,” he laughed. “I can’t find but
one chap who is willing to go in for the pole-vault,
and he’s only doing it as a favor to me and
will probably back out when he’s once tried it
and has found that he can’t do twelve feet the
first time.”</p>

<p>Dick had purchased every book on the subject
of track and field athletics that he could hear of
and was studying them diligently. He knew,
perhaps, as little at the start as any fellow in
school in regard to track and field work and
training methods. But he talked with every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
who could help him, especially Mr. Cobb, and, as
I have said, studied all the literature to be found.
The result was that by the time outdoor work was
reached he knew a good deal on the subject, although
much of his knowledge was as yet theoretical,
and would have impressed the wiliest veteran
athlete as being an old hand. A portion of Dick’s
philosophy, if ever formulated in words, would
have run something like this: “Know how if you
can; if you can’t, keep your mouth shut and look
wise.”</p>

<p>When, three weeks after the formation of the
team, an election for captain was held, the members
suddenly realized that there was only one
among them who possessed the requisite knowledge
to fill the office successfully, only one whom
they placed faith in. Six fellows got on to their
feet at the same moment and nominated Dick
Somes and about a dozen more seconded the nomination.
Further nominations not following, Dick
was unanimously elected, accepting the honor with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
becoming modesty. Sid was promoted to manager
and Fernald became assistant.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Roy after the meeting was over,
“that went all right.”</p>

<p>“According to program,” agreed Chub cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You fellows may think it was cheeky of me to
get up the team and then have myself elected captain,”
said Dick, “but I know that I’m the only
fellow here who can see the thing through. And I
suppose that sounds conceited.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might from some one else,” said Roy,
“but it doesn’t from you, Dick. Anyhow, it’s
just about so. If any fellow can make a track
team go here it’s you. And I hope you’ll succeed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll succeed all right,” answered Dick
calmly. “Of course I don’t look for many victories
this year, but if we get the team started
it’ll keep a-going, and next year or the year after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that we’ll show a few of those conceited Hammondites
what we can do.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had some of your confidence,” sighed
Chub. “If I had I’d feel better about base-ball.”</p>

<p>“Chub’s an optimist when it comes to other
people’s affairs,” laughed Roy, “and a confirmed
growler about his own. Last year he was certain
we were going to get licked by Hammond; went
around for two weeks before the game looking as
though he’d swallowed a barrel of pickles.”</p>

<p>“Were you?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! We won, eight to seven.”</p>

<p>“It was a close call, though,” said Chub. “If
you hadn’t—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick’s heard all about that,” interrupted
Roy. “When are you going to issue that challenge
to Hammond, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Right away now. I told Sid to meet me this
evening after supper and we’d write it out.
They’re probably still smarting over losing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
second hockey game to us and that will make
them eager to lick us at something else. I want
them to propose their own grounds. In the first
place, ours won’t be fit for much this spring, and
in the next place if we’re beaten, as we’re pretty
sure to be, we’ll be able to point to the fact that
Hammond had the advantage of being on her home
field; as a matter of fact, it won’t make much difference
to us where we are. Then next year, when
we may have a chance of beating them, they’ll
have to come over here.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you aren’t the foxy one!” said Chub.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want the fellows to be discouraged
when they’re beaten,” responded Dick.
“And the more excuses they have the less they’ll
mind a defeat. I guess I’ll leave you fellows here.
I want to go to the Cottage a minute to see Harry.”</p>

<p>“We’ll come along,” said Chub.</p>

<p>Dick smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s a private matter,” he said. “You fellows
run along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” exclaimed Roy.
“He and Harry have been mighty chummy for the
last week or two, Chub. Wonder what’s up, eh?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out presently,” said Dick.</p>

<p>They had been sauntering slowly along the
path from the gymnasium and now Dick turned
to the right and walked across the wet turf.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” demanded Roy.</p>

<p>“Just here,” answered Dick, stopping and looking
off down the slope toward the river. “You
get a great view from here, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Roy as they joined him.
“What of it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only I’ve been thinking that this
would be a fine site for the new dormitory.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Chub. “I’d forgotten all
about it. Anything doing yet?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not to speak of,” answered Dick as he
turned back toward the path. “Still, I rather
think there’ll be a meeting before very long.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the mysterious chump?” asked Chub.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
“Bet you he’s thought out a scheme. Have you,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you after a while,” was the answer.
“So long.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, of course we don’t want to know,”
replied Chub. “Farewell, O Man of Mystery!”</p>

<small>THE TREASURY IS LOOTED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hammond accepted Ferry Hill’s challenge
to a dual track meet with alacrity, and, as
Dick had hoped they would, suggested that it be
held on the Hammond oval. The only thing that
Dick didn’t like was the choice of dates offered,
May 12 and June 16. The Hammond manager explained
that on other Saturday afternoons either
the track team had meets or the oval would be in
use by the base-ball team. Dick would have preferred
a date about the last of May could he have
had his choice. Five of the more promising members
of the team were members of the base-ball
nine as well, and Dick had that fact to bear in
mind. It would be impossible for them to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
part in a meet after the first of June, for then the
important contests on the diamond began, notably
the three games with Hammond.</p>

<p>Dick and Sid and the manager of the rival team
had a conference in Silver Cove one afternoon,
and the former were forced to agree on the twelfth
of May as the date of the meeting, since the June
date was out of the question for Ferry Hill and
Hammond had no other dates to offer. I fancy
the Hammond representative wondered why Ferry
Hill had sent her manager along to the conference,
because he took practically no part in the proceedings
save to agree instantly and enthusiastically
with whatever Dick said. All details were arranged,
and Dick returned to Ferry Hill very well
satisfied with everything save the time agreed
upon.</p>

<p>“The trouble is, Sid,” he explained, “that it
will take tall hustling to get the team in any kind
of shape by that time. It’s too early. However,
there’s no help for it and we’ll just have to do
the best we can. We’ll get up some sort of a class
meet for the middle of April and handicap games
for some day about a week ahead of the Hammond
meet. The fellows have got to have some experience
in real competitions. You and I, Sid, are
going to be two busy little boys from now on.”</p>

<p>And Sid looked grave and held himself half an
inch taller.</p>

<p>A couple of days later the track team was
picked. They had been at <a href="#image15">work out of doors</a> for
over a fortnight and Dick and Mr. Cobb had had
opportunities to judge of the fellows’ performances.
There had been a few defections during
the period of indoor drudgery, but on the
whole the candidates had stood by the cause very
well. After the cut fifteen fellows were left and
they represented what Mr. Cobb and Dick Somes
considered the pick of athletic ability. The team,
then, as finally chosen, consisted of Chase, Cole,
Cullum, Eaton, Fernald, Glidden, Harris, Kirby,
Porter, Post, Pryor, Somes, Townsend, Walker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and Warren; and Manager Sidney Welch, of
course. Sid had struggled gamely for a place on
the team, first trying to run the mile, then having a
fling at hurdles and finally striving to distinguish
himself at the broad jump. But his weight was
against him and Dick was forced to limit Sid’s
participation in affairs to his managerial duties,
and as Dick attended to most of those himself Sid
wasn’t overworked at any time that spring.</p>

<p>On the whole the team promised to be fairly
good; Mr. Cobb acknowledged in April that his
first judgment had been hasty. In the distances
there were four runners: Somes, Chase, Warren,
and Townsend, all of whom were doing very
creditable work. Perhaps there was some disappointment
over Dick himself, for the story had
spread throughout the school that he was a wonder
at the mile and his present performances were not
vindicating that reputation. But probably the fact
that he had so many affairs to attend to told
against his track prowess. He didn’t seem to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
any troubling about it, anyhow, and it was very
generally agreed that if he continued to make as
good a captain as he did at present he would be
doing his full duty. There was one real find, however,
to delight Dick’s heart. And that was Mr.
Thomas H. Eaton, familiarly known as Chub.
Chub was doing great work in the 100-yards dash
and very creditable in the two-twenty. Running
him close in the former event was Walker, while
at the longer distance Post was showing up well
and promised to become a fine sprinter in time.
For the middle distances there were Roy, Pryor
and Kirby, none of them above the average. Kirby
was also hurdling and he and Glidden were
showing up fairly well. The pole vault had but
one performer, Cullum of the Second Middle.
Walker and Cole were making hard work of the
jumps, and in the weight events Post, Harris and
Fernald were struggling for supremacy.</p>

<p>The class meet was held the middle of April
and, although no remarkable records were established,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
it accomplished what it was intended to and
familiarized the participants with the work. The
First Senior Class had no trouble in winning the
contest.</p>

<p>The purchase of such necessary things as jumping
and vaulting standards, poles, hurdles, shots
and hammers had left very little of the original
sum subscribed, and so each member of the team
was obliged either to buy his own costume or be
content with whatever he happened to have that
would answer. Most of them, however, were too
eager to appear in the white trunks with brown
stripes down the legs and white shirts crossed by
a brown ribbon bearing the letters F. H. T. T. to
begrudge the cost, and long before the handicap
games came off more than a dozen such costumes
could be counted on the athletic field of an afternoon.
It almost broke Sid’s heart not to be able
to sport the track regalia, but he found balm for
his sorrow in a nice little brown cloth cap bearing
the “F. H. T. T.” in front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the base-ball season had begun and
Ferry Hill was reaping a harvest of unimportant
victories over early-season antagonists. Things
promised well this spring for the nine, and Chub
was in fine feather. And so, by the way, was Sid,
for he was holding his place in left field against all
comers and learning to bat with the best of them.
Green Academy and Pottsville High and Prentice
Military came and saw and acknowledged defeat,
falling victim to the elusive curves of Post or
Kirby. And April was half gone and the affairs
of the F. H. S. I. S. claimed scant attention from
its members. Or so, at least, Roy and Chub
thought until one morning they received formal
notices in Harry’s writing to the effect that there
would be a meeting of the society the following
evening at eight o’clock—“a full attendance desired.”
A full attendance was obtained. There
wasn’t a member absent when Dick began proceedings
by producing some sheets of foolscap
from his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“The president and secretary-treasurer of the
society,” began Dick with a smile, “have been
getting busy on their own hooks lately, without
authority from the majority. When I’ve got
through telling you what we’ve been up to you
can move a vote of censure if you like—”</p>

<p>“I move it right now,” interrupted Chub.</p>

<p>“—And as presiding officer I’ll rule it out of
order.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he haughty?” asked Chub admiringly.</p>

<p>“Go ahead and ’fess up,” said Roy. “I thought
you two were up to something last month, but
since then I’ve kind of forgotten all about it.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose you haven’t thought out a
scheme to get that thirty thousand?” asked Dick.
Roy shook his head. “And how about you,
Chub?”</p>

<p>“Me? Bless you, I’ve been too busy thinking
up schemes how to hit Post’s in-shoots.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dick, “Harry and I have done the
best we could. It didn’t seem advisable to ask the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Doctor for the names of the graduates. To tell the
truth, I was afraid he’d forbid us to go ahead
with the scheme. So Harry and I have been
prospecting around ourselves and we’ve managed
to get hold of the names and addresses of fourteen
men who have graduated from here. We’re not
sure about all the addresses, but I guess we can
reach them in time. Now what I propose to do is
to send personal letters to each of them and tell
them just what we want to do and ask them how
much they’ll be willing to subscribe to set the ball
rolling. We’ve fixed up a letter here and I’ll
read it to you in a minute. Of course, we may not
get a cent this way; it’s one of those forlorn hopes
that Roy was talking about.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that time that a ‘forlorn
hope’ was a ‘touch’?” asked Chub aggrievedly.</p>

<p>“To have the thing look right,” Dick continued,
“we ought to have some stationery printed, I
think; just ‘Ferry Hill School Improvement Society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Silver Cove, N. Y., Office of the Secretary
and Treasurer’; something like that. What do
you think?”</p>

<p>“Sounds like the real thing,” answered Roy.</p>

<p>“Sure,” added Chub. “If you wrote me a letter
on that sort of paper I’d be so pleased I’d want
to mortgage the house and send the money to
you.”</p>

<p>“I think it would be perfectly dandy!” said
Harry. “Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>“Moved and carried,” announced Chub.
“Let’s hear the letter, Dick. I’ll bet if you wrote
it it’s a corker!”</p>

<p>“We wrote it between us,” answered Dick.
Harry tried her best not to look vain, but couldn’t
smother the gratified smile that insisted on showing
itself. “Here it is.” Dick opened the folded
sheets of foolscap and began to read.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“‘Dear Sir: The Ferry Hill School Improvement
Society has been recently formed for the
purpose of advancing the interests of that institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of learning, and securing much-needed improvements,
of which the most important is a new
dormitory. The School has outgrown its present
equipment, and increased accommodation for more
students is imperative if the usefulness of the
School is to be continued. As an alumnus—(“That’s
great!” Chub commented softly.)—you
will, we are sure, desire to aid your <i>alma mater</i>.
(“Perfectly swell!” breathed Chub admiringly.)
It is desired to raise the sum of Thirty Thousand
Dollars for the construction of a dormitory building
capable of holding twenty boys. What portion,
if not the whole, of the necessary amount will
you subscribe? Letters similar to this have been
sent to fourteen of the School’s more prominent
graduates and a liberal response is confidently
looked for. You will confer a great favor by corresponding
at your earliest convenient opportunity
with Miss Harriet Emery, Secretary-Treasurer,
Ferry Hill School, Silver Cove, N. Y. Trusting
that you will be able to aid this most worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
cause, I remain respectfully and fraternally yours,
<span class="smcap">Richard Somes</span>, <i>President</i>.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Dick folded the letter and looked inquiringly
about him. For a moment there was no comment.
Chub sat with his mouth wide open and a countenance
expressing awed and speechless admiration.
Even Roy was apparently too much impressed
to speak. Harry waited self-consciously.
Finally,</p>

<p>“Well,” asked Dick, “any suggestions?”</p>

<p>“Not a one,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Suggestions!” cried Chub, suddenly finding
his voice. “Why, that’s the swellest thing I ever
heard! If that doesn’t fetch ’em—why—why we
don’t want their dirty old money! Talk about
your language! There’s more language there
than I ever saw before in one pile!”</p>

<p>“This isn’t a silly joke,” protested Dick
shortly. “If you think that letter can be improved
on, why, say so, but don’t get funny.”</p>

<p>“It can’t,” said Roy with conviction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” agreed Chub.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to hear it,” said Dick with a
sigh of relief. “If we’ve been over that thing
once we’ve been over it twenty times. Haven’t
we, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Harry. “I know it by heart,
every word of it!” She closed her eyes. “‘The
Ferry Hill School Improvement Society has been
recently formed for the purpose of advancing the
int—’”</p>

<p>“We’ll take your word for it,” laughed Roy.
“Who’s going to write out fourteen letters,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“You, because you write better than any one
else.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw,” said Chub, “they ought to be typewritten.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Dick agreed. “I didn’t think of
that. It won’t cost much.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Roy, “we’re going to
spend a lot of money and maybe we won’t get any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
in return. We’ll have to pay for printing, paper,
and envelops, typewriting the letters, and for
stamps. How much have we got, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Printing and typewriting won’t cost much,”
said Dick. “Not over four dollars; and we’ll only
need twenty-eight cents’ worth of stamps. And
we’ve got—how much have we got in the treasury,
Harry?”</p>

<p>“Sixty-four dollars and ten cents,” answered
Harry very promptly. “Twenty-four dollars and
ten cents in money and a check for forty dollars.
Chub still owes ninety cents.”</p>

<p>“So I do,” murmured Chub embarrassedly.
“I’d forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s plenty,” said Dick. “We’ll get
the printing and typewriting done right away so
we can mail the letters by Saturday. You’d better
let me have about five dollars, Harry, and I’ll
give you an account of what I spend.”</p>

<p>“You must give me a receipt then,” answered
Harry, doubtfully, as she slid off the grain chest.</p>

<p>“All right,” Dick laughed. “There’s nothing
like doing things in a business-like way. You and
I’ll go over to Silver Cove to-morrow noon, Chub,
and—”</p>

<p>But Dick’s further remarks were lost for there
was a sudden exclamation of tragic dismay from
Harry where, unnoticed by the boys, she had
climbed to a box under one of the old rafters.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Roy.</p>

<p><a href="#image16">“It’s gone!” wailed Harry.</a></p>

<p>“Gone? What? Where?”</p>

<p>“The money! I put it up here for safe keeping
and now it’s gone! It’s been stolen! And—and
I’ve betrayed my trust!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>THE SOCIETY AWAITS RESULTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The three boys stared at Harry’s dismayed
countenance in bewilderment. Dick was the
first to find his voice.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he exclaimed. “Our
money? The—the funds of the society?”</p>

<p>Harry, still perched precariously on top of the
empty box, nodded silently, looking down anxiously
from face to face.</p>

<p>“But what—how did it come here?” demanded
Roy.</p>

<p>“I put it up here on top of this rafter for safe
keeping,” wailed Harry. “I didn’t think it was
safe to have so much money in the house; one summer
there was a thief broke in and stole a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
things, you know! So I put it in a little chamois
bag and tied it up tight and put it up here on this
joist, right in the corner here. And now—now it’s
gone as anything!” And Harry’s voice hinted of
tears.</p>

<p>“Don’t you care,” said Chub cheerfully. “We’ll
find it all right, Harry. It couldn’t have walked
off by itself. We’ll have a good hunt for it.
Where is there a ladder?”</p>

<p>“I know,” answered Roy, disappearing into the
shadows at the farther end of the barn. Harry
jumped down from the box and when the ladder
arrived it was placed against the rafter and Dick
climbed up to where he could look along the dusty
ledge.</p>

<p>“Nothing here,” he said promptly. “It must
have fallen down. Look around underneath, fellows.
Bring the lantern.”</p>

<p>“Stop your swearing,” exclaimed Methuselah
mildly, his head stuck interestedly out of his box.
Dick, climbing down the ladder, absent-mindedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
stretched out his hand and was rewarded with a
playful nip which almost caused him to lose his
footing. Roy had brought the lantern and for
some minutes the four searched carefully about
the barn floor. Methuselah, apparently elated at
having nipped Dick’s finger and much excited by
the commotion, strutted and climbed about his
cage and chattered incessantly. In the end they
had to acknowledge defeat. They sat down and
eyed each other questioningly.</p>

<p>“The only thing I can think of,” said Dick
finally, “is that rats or mice must have found it
and carried it away.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there are any rats or mice
here,” said Harry, “except those in the cages.
Spot caught them all ages ago.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Roy, “it was too big and heavy
for a rat to lug away.”</p>

<p>“They might have chewed it to pieces, though,”
Chub suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we’d have found the pieces,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“It was stolen,” said Harry solemnly.</p>

<p>“Who stole it?” Roy asked. Harry shook her
head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said. “Maybe, though,
there was a tramp or some one in the barn when I
put it up there, and he saw me do it and went and
got it afterward.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s possible,” agreed Dick. “But I
don’t think any tramp would get so far from the
road as this, even for a place to sleep. Besides,
there’s Snip.”</p>

<p>“Snip sleeps at the Cottage,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Well, if it was stolen, whoever stole it must
have seen you put it there, because no one would
ever think of looking on top of a rafter in a barn
for money.” Dick hesitated. Then, “How about
John, the gardener?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, he wouldn’t steal anything,” declared
Harry emphatically. “Besides, he wasn’t in here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
when I put the money there. Because when I got
back to the Cottage he was shoveling the snow
from the steps.”</p>

<p>“How long ago did you put it there?” Chub
asked. Harry thought a moment.</p>

<p>“About a month ago,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Then if it’s stolen,” Chub said, “I guess the
fellow who got it has spent it by this time. I’m
glad I didn’t pay that ninety cents, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Roy laughed.</p>

<p>“There’s just one of us here,” he said, “who
probably knows who took it, and he can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean?” asked Chub.</p>

<p>“Methuselah, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Harry. “That’s so, isn’t it?
And to think that he can’t tell us!”</p>

<p>“You might ask him,” Dick suggested. The
others smiled; all save Harry. She jumped up
and walked gravely across to the cage. Methuselah
ceased his chatter as she drew near, put his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
head on one side and studied her inquiringly with
his beady eyes.</p>

<p>“’Thuselah,” said Harry, “won’t you please
tell us who stole our money?”</p>

<p>The parrot blinked, ruffled his feathers and put
one foot through the bars until his yellow claws
were clasped tightly about Harry’s finger. Then
he chuckled hoarsely.</p>

<p>“He does know,” said Harry sadly, “and he
wants very much to tell me. Don’t you, you old
dear?”</p>

<p>“Roy!” said Methuselah suddenly and sharply.
Harry started back in alarm and the others broke
into laughter.</p>

<p>“Give it back, Roy,” said Chub. “You might
as well, you know; you’re discovered.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?” said Harry
severely. “You mustn’t tell lies, ’Thuselah.”</p>

<p>“He saw you all right,” laughed Chub. “Better
’fess up, Roy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s a traitor,” said Roy, smiling. “I gave
him a nickel to keep still about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, the money’s gone,” said Dick, “and
there’s no use in crying over spilled milk. After
all, we’re only out about twenty-four dollars.
I’ll write to the bank and tell them not to pay that
check, if they haven’t done it already. Meanwhile
we’ve got to have money to get that printing
done and to pay for the typewriting and
stamps. So I’ll advance it. If we find the money
again you can pay it back to me, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I shall make it up myself,” said Harry resolutely.
“It may take me a long time, but I’ll pay
it all back.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried Roy.</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” said Dick.
“It wasn’t your fault.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was. I shouldn’t have put it there. It
was a very silly thing to do. I ought to have put
it in the bank.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Chub. “I guess every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
fellow is willing to stand his share of the loss.
And I tell you what I’ll do: I’ll pay that ninety
cents I owed next Saturday, as soon as I get my
next allowance.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t give it to me,” said Harry sadly.
“I’m not going to be treasurer any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you are,” said Dick cheerfully. “As
soon as we get some more funds you’re to look
after them. Isn’t she, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Roy and Chub heartily.</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Roy, “I wouldn’t be surprised
if we found that money yet.”</p>

<p>“Going to give it back, are you?” asked Chub
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” answered Roy. “I’ll think I did
swipe it if you keep on talking about it.”</p>

<p>“Thunder!” exclaimed Dick suddenly. “It’s
almost ten o’clock! We’ll get the dickens if we
don’t run for it. Grab the lantern and come on.
The meeting’s adjourned!”</p>

<p>Three days later the fourteen letters, neatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
typewritten on paper bearing the inscription
“Ferry Hill School Improvement Society”
printed across the top in impressively large and
black type, and signed “Richard Somes, President,”
were mailed to their destinations, and there
was nothing for the members of the society to do
but await results. The barn had been thoroughly
searched by daylight, but the missing chamois bag
with the society’s funds had not been found. The
bank in New York had replied that Dick’s check
had not been presented and that if it was it would
not be honored. For the rest, the members accepted
their losses philosophically, while Chub, to
prove his faith in the treasurer, paid over to her
on Saturday the sum of ninety cents. This, representing
the entire assets of the society, Harry
wore pinned inside of her dress, in an envelop.
And for the first day she felt anxiously for it
every few minutes.</p>

<p>April hurried along with uncertain skies and
warm days, and Spring Vacation came and went.
By the first of May the cinder track was in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
hard condition and every afternoon the track team
worked like Trojans, every fellow animated by the
resolve to do his full share toward winning success
in the meet with Hammond, now only a little
more than a week distant. Dick grew more hopeful
as the days passed, and after the handicap
meeting on the Saturday before the Hammond
games, he even dared think of the possibility of a
victory over the rival school.</p>

<p>“I can figure it out on paper,” he told Roy, “so
that we win by three points. But of course that
means that every fellow must do a little bit better
than he did to-day.”</p>

<p>Roy had won the quarter-mile from Pryor and
Kirby with a small handicap and was consequently
feeling pretty optimistic himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Hammond’s team is so awfully
good this year, anyhow,” he declared. “They lost
four of their best men last spring, you know. If
we were only a little better in the field events we
might stand a pretty good show of winning, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I know, but you can look for Cole to do some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
good work next Saturday at the broad jump, and
as for the hammer and shot, why, we’ve got just
as good men as they have, I guess. It’s the hurdles
and pole-vault that I’m worrying about. A
chap can’t learn how to hurdle in two months.
Both Kirby and Glidden were as slow as cold molasses
to-day, and Kirby knocked down every bar
except one in the two-twenty.”</p>

<p>“I thought you had Chase there in the mile for
a while,” said Roy. “It looked to me as though
you were going to pass him at the beginning of
that last lap.”</p>

<p>“I thought so too,” answered Dick, “but he had
more wind left than I had. I don’t know why it is,
but I haven’t been able to do anything like my best
this spring. I’ll have to get a move on next Saturday
if I’m going to win a point. I’d feel like
the dickens if I didn’t, you know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” answered Roy. “You’ll
do all right.”</p>

<small>METHUSELAH SUBSCRIBES TO THE FUND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Two days later, on Monday, there was a meeting
of the F. H. S. I. S., the call having been
hurriedly issued by the secretary-treasurer in person.
And when the members of the society were
assembled in the barn Harry produced triumphantly
three letters.</p>

<p>“They came this morning,” she said excitedly,
“and I haven’t opened them yet. I thought you’d
all like to be here when I did, you know. Here’s
two from New York and one from Cleveland,
Ohio, and—and they all feel as though they had
something in them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Chub. “Open ’em up!”</p>

<p>“You do it,” said Harry, handing the letters to
Dick. There was a moment of silent suspense
while Dick carefully slit the first envelop with his
knife. Out came a letter and—a check!</p>

<p>“How much?” cried the others in chorus. Dick
looked at it, scowled and glanced at the few lines
in the letter. Then:</p>

<p>“Five dollars,” he said blankly.</p>

<p>There was a moment of disappointment, broken
by Chub.</p>

<p>“Mail it back to him,” he said disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Try the next one,” murmured Harry. Dick
did so. Again a check came into sight.</p>

<p>“Fifty,” said Dick encouragedly.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” said Roy. “Try the next.
Let’s know the worst.”</p>

<p>Dick opened the third letter, unfolded the sheet
of paper within and looked on all sides of it.
There was no check.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rotten!” growled Chub. “What’s the beast
say?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right!” cried Dick who had been reading
the letter. “He promises five hundred whenever
we get ready to use the money!”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” said Roy. “He’s all right,
he is! What’s his beautiful name?”</p>

<p>“Lemuel Fish,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Roy, when the laughter had subsided,
“he may not be much on name, but he’s all
right on promises.”</p>

<p>“He’s a promising man,” murmured Chub.</p>

<p>“You don’t think the promise is—is fishy?”
asked Harry, and for a moment didn’t know why
the others laughed. “But I didn’t mean to make
a pun,” she declared earnestly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Harry,” teased Roy, “I saw you thinking
that up whole minutes ago! And such a weak
pun, too!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t! I didn’t!” cried Harry, stamping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
her foot, between smiling and frowning. Methuselah,
who had so far been perched comfortably
on her shoulder and behaving himself thoroughly,
resented being jarred and so climbed down to the
lid of the grain chest and from there to the barn
floor, sidling off into the semi-darkness behind the
harness-room with many cunning chuckles.</p>

<p>“Oh, he will pay all right,” said Dick. “He’s
a railroad man according to his letter-head, and
railroad men are all rich, you know.”</p>

<p>“Are they?” asked Chub. “Let’s start a railroad
instead of a dormitory, then. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>“Let’s see how much we’ve got subscribed,”
suggested Roy. “Five hundred and fifty and five
and forty—”</p>

<p>“Wait,” cried Harry. “I’m secretary! I’ll
make a list of the subscriptions.” She started to
work on the pad she carried, and the others waited
patiently while she frowned and labored. Presently,

<p>“Well,” said Chub, “that’s something, even if
it is a long way from thirty thousand.”</p>

<p>“And there are eleven people still to hear
from,” said Harry hopefully.</p>

<p>“The one I wanted most to get a reply from,”
said Dick, “hasn’t written yet. I hope he will.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” Roy asked.</p>

<p>“David Kearney.”</p>

<p>“What? The banker? Why, he’s worth millions!”</p>

<p>“That’s why I hope he’ll answer us,” said
Dick dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you mean that he went to school here?”
asked Chub incredulously. Dick nodded.</p>

<p>“He was here for two years just after the school
started, about twenty-three years ago. I don’t
think he graduated, though. But that wouldn’t
make any difference if he wanted to give us some
money. He gives lots, you know. Only last fall
he gave a small fortune to some little old college
in Pennsylvania that no one ever heard of
before.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d registered that letter,” said
Chub thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t want it to miss
him.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me it’s time he wrote, if he’s going
to,” said Roy.</p>

<p>“Oh, men like Kearney are pretty busy, I
guess,” said Dick. “There’s plenty of time yet.
I was rather hoping that he’d give a good big
sum, say ten or twenty thousand. If we could get
some one to give that much I’ll bet we wouldn’t
have much trouble raising the rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>“I love the way Dick talks about ten or twenty
thousand as though it was fifty cents,” sighed
Chub. “Why, if I saw twenty thousand dollars
coming along on the other side of the street, I’d
be so scared I’d run up an alley! But Dick—why,
Dickums would just smile and walk across
and slap it on the back!”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Harry seriously, “that we’ve
done awfully well. Why, just think, when we began
we didn’t have a cent! And now we’ve got
over six hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>“By the way, where are you keeping it, Harry?”
asked Roy.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Don’t tell!” Chub cried. “He
wants to swipe this, too!”</p>

<p>“Say, shut up about that, will you?” growled
Roy. “I don’t mind a joke, but you’re wearing
it out, you know.”</p>

<p>“In the bank,” answered Harry. “I’ve opened
an account; ‘Harriet Emery, Treasurer’; and
I’ve got a real bank-book! And if we let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
money stay in the bank for three months we’ll
get three per cent. interest on it!”</p>

<p>“Then I guess that’s the best way to get the
thirty thousand,” laughed Chub. “Just let it lie
in the bank until the accumulated interest—”</p>

<p>“Steady!” cautioned Roy.</p>

<p>“—amounts to the other twenty-nine thousand
four hundred.”</p>

<p>“You’re a chump,” said Dick. “And you won’t
get three per cent. for three months, Harry; it’s
three per cent. a year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that it?” asked Harry disappointedly.
“But I’d get something, wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, one fourth of three per cent.” Harry
began to figure earnestly.</p>

<p>“What I want to know,” said Chub, “is why
you’ve got the money we lost down on the subscription
list.”</p>

<p>“Because,” answered Dick, “Harry insists that
she’s going to pay it back.”</p>

<p>“She’s going to do nothing of the sort!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Roy indignantly. “She may pay her five
dollars back and we’ll all do the same, but there’s
no reason why she should pay it all!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I tell her,” Dick replied, “but
you know Harry’s a little bit—well, a little bit
stubborn, Roy.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” declared Harry, without raising
her head from the tablet upon which she was figuring.
“And I am going to pay it back. It was
in my—my custody, and I am responsible. I’d
like to know what folks would do if treasurers
could lose money entrusted to them and not have
to pay it back!”</p>

<p>“But you’re not a real treasurer—” began
Chub.</p>

<p>“Why, Chub Eaton!” exclaimed Harry indignantly.
“I am, too!”</p>

<p>“I mean,” exclaimed Chub lamely, “that you
aren’t under bonds, you know, and—”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I’m going to make res—restitution!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” said Roy just then in an odd
voice, “that it’s going to be necessary to make
restitution.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Harry.</p>

<p>Roy pointed past her into the twilight of the
barn.</p>

<p>“Ask Methuselah,” he said.</p>

<p>The others turned, following his outstretched
finger with their eyes. Out from under the shapeless
form of a mowing machine walked Methuselah,
his beady eyes glittering in the gloom, his
head cocked on one side and his yellow beak closed
over an object which at first glance looked like a
piece of brown paper folded into a tiny parcel. In
an instant Harry had swooped down upon the
astounded bird and was dancing back with a small
chamois bag in her hand.</p>

<p>“It’s the money!” she cried. The boys crowded
around her while she untied the little pink string
with trembling fingers and while Methuselah,
quite forgotten, smoothed his feathers and scolded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
angrily. Out came the bills and coins and Dick’s
check, all intact.</p>

<p>“Methuselah was the thief, I’ll bet a hat!”
cried Chub.</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Dick. “But I don’t see how he
ever got up on that rafter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he climbs around everywhere when I let
him out,” said Harry excitedly. “And he’s a
terrible thief. Don’t you remember the time he
stole the turnip seeds and ate them?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad he didn’t eat this,” said Roy.
“I wonder where he found it now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he probably lugged it off somewhere and forgot
all about it,” said Dick. “And just now when
he went roaming around he came across it and—”</p>

<p>“And he knew we wanted it,” completed Harry,
“and brought it to us! Isn’t he a darling?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all in the way you look at it,”
Roy laughed. “Considering that he stole it in the
first place—and tried to put the blame on me—!”</p>

<p>“I tell you what!” exclaimed Chub. “’Thuselah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
was mad because we didn’t elect him to office
and so he thought he’d make himself assistant
treasurer! Bet you that’s the way of it.”</p>

<p>Harry left the recovered treasure in Dick’s care
and picked up the disgruntled parrot, stroking his
head and murmuring soothingly:</p>

<p>“He was des a booful ’Thuselah,” she cooed.
“An’ he found the money, so he did, and bringed
it straight back, didn’t um?”</p>

<p>“Um did,” laughed Roy. “Um’s an old rascal.”
But he scratched Methuselah’s head with
his finger, and the parrot closed his eyes and
looked forgiving.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Chub. “We’d all got fixed
to pay back that money, so let’s do it. Then we’ll
put this down as ’Thuselah’s subscription to the
cause. What do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” cried Harry. She thrust the parrot
into Roy’s arms and flew to the grain chest.
She was busy an instant with pencil and pad, and
then, “Here it is!” she cried:</p>

<p>“Methuselah ... $24.10.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>GOSSIP AND A MEETING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Harry and Dick were sitting on the lower
step of the little flight leading to the Cottage
porch. It was between ten and eleven of a
perfect May morning. The crumbling red bricks
paving the short path which led to the curving
drive glowed warmly in the sun, and the little
blades of grass springing up between them were
very green and pert. The campus looked vastly
different to-day from what it had that January
afternoon when Harry had introduced Dick to
Ferry Hill. To-day there was the bluest of blue
skies overhead, and instead of the waste of snow
the grass stretched away on every side fresh and
verdant. The Grove was fast clothing itself in
new, tender green, and beyond, at the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
long hill, the river dimpled and shone in the sunshine.
Something of this occurred to Harry, I
think, for she stopped pulling Snip’s ear—an operation
which that member of the group, half-asleep
in the sunlight, thoroughly approved of—and
asked:</p>

<p>“Dick, do you remember the day I brought you
up here to show you the school? And how cold it
was? And how nasty and dismal everything
looked? After you’d gone I never thought for a
minute that you’d come back.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” answered Dick with a little
laugh. “I guess I’d have stayed at Hammond
and liked it all right if I hadn’t got there before
school opened. It seemed so beastly lonesome
over there, and the fellows who stayed during vacation
were such a ghastly bunch, that I just had
to get out. It was a toss-up whether I’d come
over here and try this or hit the trail for home.”</p>

<p>“Are you sorry you came?” asked Harry
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a bit,” replied Dick with convincing heartiness.
“I like it, and I like you and Chub and Roy.
You’ve all been so decent to me, you know.
You’re all three mighty good fellows, Harry.”</p>

<p>Harry flushed and looked pleased.</p>

<p>“I—I guess we liked you,” she said. “I’m
glad you like Roy and Chub,” she continued. “I
just love them! They’re—they’re the nicest
boys I ever knew, I guess; and you too, Dick.”</p>

<p>Dick shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“I’m jealous,” he said. “You put Roy and
Chub first.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I’ve known them longer, Dick,”
answered Harry earnestly. “You don’t mind, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” he laughed. “Besides, next year
they won’t be here, and you’ll have to like me
best.”</p>

<p>Harry looked grave.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” she sighed. “When you
get to like a boy he goes and graduates and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
you never see him again. I don’t know what I’ll
do when Roy and Chub go.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know what I’ll do, for that matter,”
growled Dick. “It’ll be beastly lonely at first.
Maybe I won’t come back myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick, you must!” cried Harry. “Why,
then there wouldn’t be any one! You’ve got to
come back! You will, won’t you, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Maybe.”</p>

<p>“No, promise!”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll come, Harry. You and I’ll
have to comfort each other, eh? Say, isn’t this a
dandy day? Hope it’ll be like this Saturday, eh?”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be,” said Harry decisively.
“John says we’re in for a spell of settled weather,
and he knows all about it; he never misses.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he’s right. I want a good hard
track on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we can beat them?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>Dick hesitated, then shook his head slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>“Honestly, I don’t. But I’m not telling the
fellows that. It doesn’t help any, that sort of
talk. I tell them we can win if we do our level
best; and we can; the trouble is that every fellow
can’t do his level best when the time comes. Lots
of them will be nervous, you know; can’t help it.
I may be myself. By the way, Sid got a note from
their manager yesterday asking if we would mind
changing the order of events so that the mile run
will come last; he says two of their men who are
going to run the mile are in the low hurdles and
they wouldn’t have time to get their wind. I told
Sid to write and say it would be all right. It
doesn’t matter to us, although I suppose if we insisted
on having the things run off the way we first
agreed to we’d have a better chance to win the
meet.”</p>

<p>“But it wouldn’t seem quite fair, would it, to
make those boys run in the mile just after they’d
been hurdling?”</p>

<p>“Well, it would be fair enough, I guess; that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
their lookout, you know; only—well, I don’t want
to win that way. I say let every fellow have an
even chance, and then the one that wins is the best
man.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to practise this afternoon?”
Harry asked.</p>

<p>“No, on account of the ball game with Whittier.
But to-morrow we’ll have a good stiff afternoon
of it. Then Friday we’ll rest up. That reminds
me: Sid’s trying to get up a meet with Prentice
Military Academy for some time the last of June.
I hope he fixes it, for if he doesn’t the fellows
won’t keep in training; and if they don’t it will be
all the harder to get in form again next year. I
wish we were sure of having a decent track here
next spring. If only the dormitory business had
turned out better I guess the Doctor would have
been willing to spend some money on the field and
track.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ll ever get the money for the
dormitory, Dick?” asked Harry wistfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure to, sooner or later,” he answered stoutly.
“But it’s slow going, isn’t it? Haven’t had any
more letters, have you?”</p>

<p>Harry shook her head.</p>

<p>“Not one. I think some people are too mean
for anything!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Dick laughed, “I dare say they’ve got
plenty of uses for their money. We’ll get it yet.
This summer I’ll strike dad for a thousand. If
he’s had good luck he will give it in a minute.
And when we’ve got two thousand pledged I
guess your father will be willing to help us. He
will see then that we’re in earnest.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he will,” said Harry. “And isn’t
it too funny for anything about his being honorary
president and not knowing it? Oh, Dick! What
time is it?”</p>

<p>“Twenty of eleven,” answered Dick, looking at
his watch.</p>

<p>“I’ll be late if I don’t go this minute! And I’ll
have to run half the way anyhow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t have to go until two on
Wednesdays,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Eleven; it’s that awful music. ‘Do, re, mi, fa,
sol—’ Good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” answered Dick, getting up and
looking around for his books. “I’ll see you at
the game this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” called Harry from the door. “And I
hope we win.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can’t help it,” laughed Dick. “It’s a
way we have at Ferry Hill!”</p>

<p>But they didn’t win; not unless the score lied.
Seven to five it was when the last inning was over.
Whittier Collegiate Institute had some good batters
on her team and they had little trouble in
finding Post and Kirby for twelve hits. Chub was
inclined to be doleful after the game.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” he repeated over and over.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Dick. “The trouble was only
that you fellows haven’t been practising enough
the last week. It’s my fault entirely. I’ve been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
after you for track work, and you can’t do two
things at once and do them well. I’m sorry, Chub,
but after Saturday I’ll let you alone.”</p>

<p>“Think that’s it?” asked Chub, more cheerfully.
“Well, if it is, I don’t mind so much. Whittier
isn’t Hammond, after all. And if we make
a good showing Saturday I shan’t mind losing
to-day’s game. What do you say, Roy?”</p>

<p>“Me?” asked Roy, trotting away to the shower-bath.
“Oh, I’m not worrying about anything.”</p>

<p>Events proved John the gardener to be a real
weather prophet, for Saturday dawned clear and
warm. The track and field meeting with Hammond
was to begin at half past two, and at
half past twelve Harry, music-roll in hand, was
hurrying back along the dusty road from her
music-lesson, fearful that she wouldn’t get
through luncheon in time to cross to Coleville on
the first launch. Silver Cove was half a mile behind
her and the tower of School Hall was already
in sight above the tree-tops when the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
wheels reached her from the road behind. A station
carriage drawn by a dejected white horse and
driven by a freckle-faced youth of seventeen or
eighteen years was approaching unhurriedly from
the direction of the Cove. In the rear seat, as
Harry saw when the carriage overtook her, sat a
gentleman in a neat gray suit, derby hat and
brown gloves. The gloves were especially noticeable
since they looked very new and were clasped
tightly about the handle of a slenderly rolled umbrella
which stood between his knees. He was
about forty years old, had a round, smiling face,
shrewd brown eyes and a short, bristly mustache
which terminated at each side in a sharp, waxed
point. As the carriage jolted past in its little
cloud of dust the occupant of the back seat, who
had been observing the pedestrian for several
minutes, laid a hand on the driver’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Stop,” he said.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” commanded the boy. “Whoa, I tell
yer! Can’t yer stop nohow, yer pesky brute?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>The horse showed as little inclination to stop as
before it had shown to go, and when the vehicle
finally drew up motionless, with the driver still
scolding fretfully at the steed, it was some little
distance beyond Harry. But it was quite evident
that the occupants were awaiting her, and so she
hurried up to it under the smiling scrutiny of the
passenger. She had been walking fast, the forenoon
was quite warm and her face was flushed as
a result. Also the dust had settled upon her shoes
and half way up her ankles, and Harry was sensible
of not appearing at her best, a fact which
annoyed her since the immaculate appearance of
the stranger seemed to set a standard of neatness.
Then she was looking up into a pair of smiling
brown eyes, and—</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said the man. “May I offer
you a seat?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>MR. KEARNEY MAKES AN OFFER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Well, it really was warm, and she was in a
hurry, and the man in the carriage smiled
so nicely, and—and the next thing Harry knew she
was sitting beside him, smoothing her skirts and
trying to hide her dusty shoes, and the horse was
once more jogging along the road. She wasn’t
sure whether she had thanked him, so she determined
to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said in her most polite and
ladylike tones.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he replied. “I’m under obligations
to you, young lady. I am delighted to have
some one to talk to. So far my journey has been
a trifle dull. My friend on the front seat is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
communicative and all my efforts to find a subject
of mutual interest have failed. I fancy he is a
very wise youth, he says so little. Did you happen
to observe him as we passed you?”</p>

<p>Harry nodded a trifle embarrassedly, for the
subject under discussion could hear every word.</p>

<p>“Yes? And did he strike you as having a most
intelligent appearance?”</p>

<p>“He will hear you,” whispered Harry.</p>

<p>“That’s true,” replied the man. “So we
mustn’t flatter him any more. Many noble natures,
I dare say, have been spoiled by flattery.”</p>

<p>The boy growled irritatedly at the horse, and
the man turned to Harry with raised brows and an
expression which said: “There! Have I over-praised
him? Isn’t he wonderful?” Harry felt a
strong inclination to giggle, but refrained out of
consideration for the boy’s feelings and smiled
instead. The man smiled back at her and after
that they suddenly seemed to have become very
good friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>“You live around here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, at Ferry Hill,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“Really? Now that’s where I’m bound. Then
you must know the principal there, Doctor Emery,
I think his name is.”</p>

<p>“He’s my father,” answered Harry. “I’m
Harry—that is, Harriet Emery.”</p>

<p>“O—oh!” said the man, and Harry thought he
viewed her with a new interest. “So you’re Miss
Harriet, are you? Well, my name is—but there,
it isn’t polite to force one’s acquaintance on a
lady.” Harry didn’t see the logic of this, and
would have intimated the fact had he not gone on.
“I used to go to school here myself a good many
years ago,” he said. “I suppose things have
changed lots since then. New buildings, of course,
and everything thoroughly up-to-date?”</p>

<p>“There’s only one new building, I guess,” said
Harry, “and that’s the gymnasium. Was the
Cottage there when you went to school?”</p>

<p>“Cottage? No, I think not. The Cottage is—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s where we live,” Harry answered. “There
are only four buildings, you know: School Hall,
the dormitory, the gymnasium and the cottage.
But we’re trying to get a new—” Harry stopped
suddenly. Then, “Oh!” she cried, turning with
eager eyes, “are you rich?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a difficult question to answer,”
replied the man with a laugh. “I would probably
be called rich around here, but where I live I’m
only—well, let us say comfortably off. May I inquire
your reason for asking?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think me very impolite,” said
Harry earnestly, “but I didn’t mean to be. I
asked, because if you are rich we would like very
much to have you subscribe to the dormitory fund.
Do you think you could?”</p>

<p>“Possibly. Supposing you tell me something
about it. For instance, how much is it going to
cost, and how much is already subscribed? But
perhaps you aren’t acquainted with the details?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am. I’m the secretary and treasurer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
of the society, the Ferry Hill School Improvement
Society, you know.” The man bowed
gravely, but his brown eyes held a disconcerting
twinkle. “It—it’s going to cost thirty thousand
dollars,” Harry went on; “and we have got six
hundred and thirty-nine dollars and eighty cents.”</p>

<p>“I see; you’ve just started, then.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been at it four months,” answered
Harry a trifle disconsolately.</p>

<p>“Really? Then you haven’t progressed very
well, have you? What seems to be the trouble?”</p>

<p>And Harry told him. She found a very attentive
and sympathetic listener, and she traced the
progress of the undertaking from the moment of
its inception to the present time, becoming now
and then very eloquent and very incoherent. But
her audience seemed to approve of her enthusiasm
and toward the end even seemed to catch it.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll succeed,” he said when she had
finished breathlessly. “I really do. It was a big
undertaking for four young folks like you, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
you’ve shown pluck. I’d like to meet this Dick
Somebody; he seems to be the kind of boy that
grows up to big things. But you’ve all been
mighty plucky, I think. We’ll talk about it again,
Miss Harriet. I suppose this is where we turn in,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. If you tell him to drive to the Cottage
you’ll find papa there, I think, because it’s
almost time for luncheon. We’re having it a little
earlier than usual on account of the track meet
with Hammond this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Hammond!” exclaimed the man. “That
sounds natural. When I went to school here we
used to have great fights with Hammond, regular
rough-and-tumble battles out on the island down
there; and we played base-ball with them, too; I
used to pitch; thought pretty well of myself, too;
had an in-curve that used to puzzle them all! But
we usually got licked, though. How about it
now?”</p>

<p>“We beat them more times than they beat us,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
said Harry proudly. “We have a dandy base-ball
team this spring, and this afternoon we’re
going to meet them at running and jumping and
hurdling—track athletics, you know.”</p>

<p>“Really? This afternoon? My, I’ll have to
see that! Going to beat them, are you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Harry. “I’m afraid not.
You see, it’s our first year at it; we never had a
track team until Dick started it two months ago;
and so we aren’t very good yet. But next
year—!”</p>

<p>“That’s what we used to say,” laughed the
man. “And then when next year came—why, we
said it again! Do you know, I’d give a whole lot
to see Ferry Hill beat Hammond? I really would,
Miss Harriet! I feel the old antagonism rising up
inside of me at the mention of the name of Hammond.
The fellows there now aren’t the ones I
used to know, of course; ‘Tricky’ Peters and
Jerry Gould and—and what was that big red-headed
fellow’s name, I wonder! Prout! That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
was it; Prout! Dear me, how I used to hate that
fellow Prout! I wonder what became of him.
Jerry Gould has an office in my building and we’ve
often talked over old times. He declares he made
a home-run off of me once, but I don’t believe it, by
Jingo! What time does this athletic contest take
place?”</p>

<p>“At half past two, sir.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing! I’ll go and see it. Will you
take me, Miss Harriet? Good! And—and didn’t
you say that this Dick Somebody got up the
team?”</p>

<p>“Dick Somes; yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And he’s the same one that’s president of
the Improvement Society?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. You see him and tell him
that if he will lick Hammond this afternoon I’ll
subscribe to the dormitory fund, handsomely too!
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him,” answered Harry breathlessly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
“But—but I don’t believe it will make any difference,
because he’ll do the best he can anyhow;
and so will the other boys. But I’ll tell him, sir.
How much shall I say you’ll subscribe?”</p>

<p>“Well, now you’re getting right down to brass
tacks, aren’t you?” laughed the man. “I must
think about that. Is this the Cottage? I’ll have
to beg some lunch, I guess. Do you suppose your
mother will let me have some?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Harry eagerly. “I’ll
invite you myself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” he answered with a
smile. “And I’ll accept before you change your
mind. And after lunch we’ll have another talk
about this matter. You want a new dormitory and
I want to see Ferry Hill lick Hammond, and
maybe we’ll be able to get together, eh? Stop
here, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Whoa thar! Whoa, I tell yer!” chided the
freckle-faced driver. “Don’t yer hear me, yer old
galoot? Whoa, I say!”</p>

<p>Harry’s new friend jumped nimbly out and gallantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
assisted her. Then he paid the boy, adding
a dollar for good measure.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” growled the boy. “Gedap!”</p>

<p>The carriage trundled away and the man looked
admiringly after.</p>

<p>“I leave it to you, Miss Harriet,” he said in
awed tones. “Did I overestimate his intelligence
one mite? Did I not rather err on the side of moderation?
And now shall we go in?”</p>

<p>As they entered Doctor Emery was crossing the
hall, and Harry ran to him.</p>

<p>“Papa,” she said, “here’s a gentleman who’s
come to lunch with us. I invited him and it’s all
right. He used to go to school here and he’s going
to—to—”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to see you, sir,” said the Doctor,
shaking hands. “Very glad to welcome one
of our old boys back again, although I fancy you
were here before my day. May I ask your name,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Kearney, David Kearney, Doctor. Yes, I left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
here before you took hold; over twenty years ago
it was. I met your daughter on the road, begged
the pleasure of her company and was rewarded
with an invitation to lunch. But if it is going to
put Mrs. Emery to any trouble—”</p>

<p>“Why, not a bit, Mr. Kearney. We shall consider
it an honor to entertain a man who has—er—fashioned
so successful a career, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Kearney gravely.
“And I shall feel more honored to lunch with the
honorary president.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” asked the Doctor blankly.</p>

<p>“Why, I am not mistaken, am I?” asked the
other with a twinkle in his eye. “You occupy the
position of honorary president of the Ferry Hill
School Improvement Society, do you not?” The
Doctor’s gaze wandered to Harry’s mischievous
face and he smiled.</p>

<p>“I fear,” he said, “there is more here than I
understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The launch was to make its first trip across to
Coleville at half past one, carrying the members
of the team and a few privileged friends, returning
later for a second load of passengers. At a
quarter past one Dick, Roy, Chub and their team-mates
were hurriedly changing their clothes in the
gymnasium, since it had been decided to dress before
crossing to Hammond. Dick was just knotting
the cords of his bath-robe about his waist
when Sid put his head in at the dressing-room
door and called to him.</p>

<p>“Say, Dick! Harry’s outside and wants to see
you right off; she says it’s very important.”</p>

<p>“All right, tell her I’ll be there in a second, Sid.
Get a move on, fellows; it’s twenty minutes past.”</p>

<p>He followed Sid through the swinging doors
and Roy and Chub, struggling into their white
and brown running costumes, viewed each other
inquiringly. Then Dick thrust the doors open.</p>

<p>“Roy and Chub!” he called. “Get something
on and come out here quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>“Must be something doing,” said Chub excitedly
as he laced his spiked shoes. Then they too
disappeared and it was the turn of the others to
wonder and speculate. Five minutes later Sid
once more appeared.</p>

<p>“Dick says for every fellow to come out right
away,” he announced. “He’s got important
news.”</p>

<p>A minute later they were all out on the porch,
crowding around Dick. Roy and Chub were beside
him, and Harry was standing with sparkling
eyes and flushed cheeks on the stone railing behind
them.</p>

<p>“What’s up, Dick?” asked Ed Whitcomb anxiously.
“Hammond hasn’t forfeited the meet,
has she?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Dick. “Shut up a minute, fellows;
I’ve got something to tell you.” When
quiet was restored he went on. “It’s a long story,
but I’ve got to make it as short as I can, so if you
have any questions to ask wait until later on. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
fellows know—or maybe you don’t know, but it’s
a fact—that we need another dormitory here at
Ferry Hill. The Doctor hasn’t much more than
paid expenses the last few years. He needs more
boys, and that means more dormitory room. So a
while back, along in January, four of us—Harry
and Roy and Chub and myself—got up a sort of a
club that we called the Ferry Hill School Improvement
Society. The purpose was to get money for a
new dormitory. We talked with the Doctor about
it, but he thought we were just sort of fooling, you
know, and wouldn’t have anything to do with it.
So we went ahead alone. We sent letters to some
of the graduates and we got about six hundred
dollars. There was one chap we wrote to who
didn’t pay any attention to our letter. You have
all heard of him, I guess: Mr. David Kearney.”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of assent.</p>

<p>“Well, he turned up here a couple of hours ago.
Instead of answering our letter he waited until he
had a chance and came up here to see us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an incipient cheer which Dick waved
down.</p>

<p>“He wants us to lick Hammond. He says that
when he was here at school, about twenty years
ago, Hammond used to beat Ferry Hill almost all
the time. Mr. Kearney played on the ball team;
used to pitch; and when Harry told him we were
going to meet Hammond on the track this afternoon
he said he was going to see it, said it would
do him a lot of good to see Ferry Hill beat Hammond
just once at something.”</p>

<p>This time the cheer would not be denied, and
Dick had to wait until it had died down before he
went on.</p>

<p>“So he has sent a message to us by Harry. ‘If,’
he says, ‘you beat Hammond this afternoon, I’ll
give the balance of the money needed for the dormitory,’
which is—how much, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-nine thousand three hundred and
sixty dollars and twenty cents,” answered Harry
promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Ph—e—ew!</em>” whistled somebody, and for a
moment bedlam broke loose.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Dick as soon as he could
make himself heard, “I know you fellows don’t
need this—this incentive to do your very best.
You’d have done that anyhow, merely for the
sake of beating our rival over there, for the sake
of Ferry Hill! But you’re not going to do any
less now that you know that so much more depends
on victory; you’re going to do a little better
than your best, fellows; you’re going over
there with a determination to lick Hammond and
bring back the championship and secure that new
dormitory! Now let’s have a cheer for Mr.
Kearney.”</p>

<p>And when it had been given,</p>

<p>“A cheer for Ferry Hill, fellows!” cried Dick.</p>

<p>And then, still shouting and cheering, they tumbled
down the steps and raced for the landing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>FERRY HILL VS. HAMMOND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The Oval at Hammond Academy lies on a
broad plateau just beyond the campus.
Back of it the hill sweeps abruptly away, covered
with a dense growth of timber. From the top of
the grand stand one can almost see the river over
the roof of the nearest dormitory. Nature has
supplied an ideal spot for an athletic ground and
human hands have made the most of it. There is
an excellent quarter-mile cinder track twelve feet
wide, supplemented by a straight-away for the 220
yards’ dash and the low hurdles. Inside the track
is a perfectly level expanse of well-kept turf which
made the Ferry Hill visitors sigh with envy. The
grand stand is small but well-built and well-maintained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
and at one end of it there is a tiny building
which serves as a dressing-room and store-house.
From its roof a short flag-pole to-day bore the
cherry-and-black banner of Hammond, while from
an improvised staff at the top of the grand stand
floated a bedraggled Ferry Hill flag.</p>

<p>The day was warm and, since there had been
no rain for some time, the little breezes made
miniature whirlwinds of dust along the track. By
half past two the stand was well filled. Ferry Hill
had preëmpted the south end, and her small band
of supporters were cheering vigorously. Below,
about the starting-line for the 100 yards’ dash, a
dozen officials, instructors and students of the two
schools, were awaiting the contestants.</p>

<p>Near the curve of the field to the right the entries
for the shot put and broad jump had gathered,
the white costumes with their dashes of
cherry-and-black or of brown gleaming brightly
against the vivid green of the level turf. The
breezes fluttered the handkerchiefs laid along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
runway to indicate the points at which the jumpers
were to find their strides, and whipped the
loose trunks tightly against straining leg muscles
as the white-clad bodies raced over the brown
path.</p>

<p>The clerk of the course, a Hammond youth,
bawled importantly for the contestants in the trial
heats of the 100 yards and presently eight youths
gathered at the head of the stretch. Three were
Ferry Hill entries and five wore the Hammond
colors. Four at a time they sped down the alleys
and Ferry Hill found cause for rejoicing, for three
of her sprinters had qualified for the finals—Post,
Eaton and Walker—while only one Hammond
man had made good.</p>

<p>Up on the grand stand Harry signified her delight
by waving the brown-and-white banner she
carried. Beside her was Mr. Kearney, and beyond
him Mrs. Emery and the Doctor. The visitor had
pleaded ignorance and Harry was explaining volubly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>“There are twelve events, you see,” she said.
“And in each one the first four fellows count.
The winner makes five points, the one coming in
second makes three, third place counts two and
fourth place one. That makes eleven points for
each event, or 132 points for the meet. And of
course the team that wins a majority of the 132
points wins the meet. Do you see what I mean?”</p>

<p>“I think so. But wouldn’t it be possible for
each side to make half of 132 points? Then nobody
would win, eh?”</p>

<p>“It would be a tie. But it doesn’t very often
happen that way, Mr. Kearney. I hope it won’t
to-day, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s better to have it decided one way or
the other, I guess. What are they going to do
now?”</p>

<p>“I think this is the 120 yards’ hurdles; the high
hurdles, they call it. We won’t do much in this
because we have only two fellows entered and
neither of them is much good. That’s Kirby, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
tall one. He’s one of the pitchers on the base-ball
team.”</p>

<p>“I see. He’s a fine looking boy, Miss Harriet.
Here they come! Hello, some one’s taken a
tumble!”</p>

<p>“It’s Glidden,” said Harry disappointedly.
“We won’t get a single point out of this, I’ll—
Oh, yes we will! Go it, Kirb! Go it! There! He
was second, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>But when the megaphone was pointed in their
direction, Baxter, official announcer, gave Hammond
first, second and fourth places and Ferry
Hill third.</p>

<p>“That makes Hammond 9 and Ferry Hill 2,”
said Harry. “Well, we didn’t expect anything
in the high hurdles, so we’re really two points
ahead, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Half-milers this way!” called the clerk.</p>

<p>Ferry Hill had three candidates for this event,
Porter, Pryor and Kirby, to Hammond’s six. But
both Roy and Pryor were expected to win places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
and Ferry Hill’s supporters cheered confidently.
Then the nine runners were poised on the mark,
the pistol barked, and there was a little struggle
for the pole. As they swept by the stand Holmes
of Hammond was making the pace, with Pryor
close behind him and Roy well back in the bunch.
At the first turn they strung out along the inner
rim of the track, the pace-maker taking it very
easy indeed. Into the back-stretch they went, nine
white-clad bodies agleam in the sunlight, and a
cheer arose from where the brown-and-white flags
fluttered as Pryor stepped around Holmes and
took the lead, setting a pace that opened up several
yards between them. After the next turn the
runners were well stretched out along the track,
and as they swept into the home-stretch and finished
the first lap and the first half of the distance
it was evident that only five of the nine would dispute
the points. These were Porter and Pryor of
Ferry Hill and Holmes, James and Garrison of
Hammond. Kirby apparently had not recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
from the high hurdles and was running next to
last, quite out of the race.</p>

<p>As the runners passed the stand the flags waved
and the cheers urged them on. It was Pryor,
Holmes, James, Porter and Garrison now, and
this order was maintained until they were once
more in the back-stretch. Then Roy passed James
and Holmes took the lead from Pryor. An eighth
of a mile from the finish the pace increased. Garrison
dropped farther and farther behind and Roy
crept past Pryor. At the turn the latter, run out,
dropped behind James and finally was overhauled
by Garrison. Into the home-stretch sped the first
three runners with scarce two yards dividing first
man from last. The stand was on its feet, flags
waving and voices straining. Then, twenty yards
from the tape, James of Hammond spurted magnificently
and had passed the two ahead of him
before they knew it. Roy with a final effort
worked loose from Holmes and crossed the line a
bare two yards back of James. Hammond 8,
Ferry Hill 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said Harry disappointedly, “that’s too
bad. Dick was counting on six points in the eight-eighty.
Let me see, that makes the score 17 to 5
in Hammond’s favor. Isn’t that just too mean
for anything?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kearney agreed smilingly that it was.
“But it’s early yet,” he said. “They’re putting
up the strings again. What does that
mean?”</p>

<p>“Final of the hundred yards’ dash,” answered
Harry. “Oh, I do hope Chub will win this!”</p>

<p>“Chub? Let me see now, he’s one of the four
conspirators—I mean one of the society, isn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. His real name is Tom, you know. That’s
he; the boy with the white sweater over his shoulders;
see?”</p>

<p>“Yes. So that’s Tom? And your name is
Harriet; and then there’s a Dick, too, isn’t
there?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Dick Somes.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. And the fourth one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>“Roy, the boy that just came in second in the
half-mile.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Kearney. “I think I
have you straightened out now. Shall we stand
up so we can see this better?”</p>

<p>Ferry Hill was certain of three places in the
100 yards since she had three of the four entries,
but it was going to make some difference which
those places were. Chub and Post and Walker
were crouching side by side, each at the head of
his alley, and with them was the lone Hammond
entry, a fellow named Ranck. Mr. Kearney ventured
a mild pun on the name, but Harry was too
intent to heed it. Then the pistol broke the stillness
and the four leaped away from the mark and
came charging down the track. It was all over in
an instant—to be exact, ten and two fifths seconds—with
Chub first by a yard and Ranck in second
place. Harry mourned the loss of second place
but looked cheerful as she scrawled a very big,
black 8 to Ferry Hill’s credit. The score so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
stood Ferry Hill 13, Hammond 20; and that looked
lots better than 5 to 17.</p>

<p>There was quite a field for the 220 yards’ dash,
and three trial heats were run before the participants
in the finals were decided on. In the end
Ferry Hill won two places and Hammond two,
Post and Chub Eaton qualifying for the brown-and-white.</p>

<p>The quarter-mile run was a tame affair, Holmes
of Hammond taking the lead at the start and never
being once headed to the tape. Roy won second
place again, followed by Pryor and Kirby, and
Ferry Hill’s stock went up several points. The
score now stood 19 for the visitors and 25 for the
home team. Things began to look more cheerful,
and Dick, looking over Sid’s shoulder as the manager
reckoned up the points, felt encouraged and
even hopeful. But ten minutes later the prospect
was very black indeed. The result of the pole
vault was made known, giving Hammond 9½
points and Ferry Hill 1½, Cullum having tied a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Hammondite for third place. Then the best Glidden
was able to do in the low hurdles was to come
in a bad fourth.</p>

<p>“The dickens!” wailed Sid. “That gives them
45½ to our 21½! I guess it’s all over but the
shouting, Dick.”</p>

<p>“And I guess we won’t have to do any of that,”
was the answer. “Isn’t the broad jump finished?
I’m going over to see. By the way, what comes
next? Two-twenty dash? Where’s Chub? Find
him and send him over to me, Sid.”</p>

<p>But the announcer was already busy with his
crimson megaphone, and Dick stopped to listen.
Ferry Hill had secured first and third places in
the broad jump and second, third and fourth in
the shot put. Sid’s pencil worked busily as the
cheers swept across from the south end of the
stand.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” breathed Dick as he watched
the totals appear. “Ferry Hill 34½, Hammond
54½.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve only gained four points,” objected Sid.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I didn’t look for anything much in
either of those events, and we got the big end of
each. Give us six points in the high jump, six in
the hammer throw and five in the two-twenty, Sid,
and see what it foots up.”</p>

<p>“Only 51½,” said Sid.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” Dick frowned perplexedly.
“We’ll have to find some more somewhere, then.
Oh, Chub! Chub Eaton! Where’s Post? Hurry
him up; I want to see you both.”</p>

<p>Affairs began to look up for Ferry Hill after
the 220 yards’ dash, for Post won handily and
Chub found the tape a bare six inches ahead of
Ranck of Hammond. Another Hammondite, Custis,
took fourth. And when the time was announced
it was found that Post had simply
knocked the top off of Hammond’s record for that
event. The latter was 24⅖ seconds, and Post had
finished in 24 flat. Then came the results of the
high jump and the hammer throw, and Ferry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Hill’s supporters went crazy with delight. In
each event the wearers of the brown-and-white
had done better than any one had dared expect.
In the jump they had secured all but two points
and in the hammer throw Fernald had sent the
weight 129 feet 6 inches, securing first place by
over four feet from his nearest competitor, Harris.
Post had got third place, leaving only one
point for the cherry-and-black. And the score
showed Ferry Hill ahead, 61½ to 59½!</p>

<p>Up on the stand Harry was dancing with glee,
deaf to the smiling remonstrances of her mother.
Mr. Kearney, too, made no effort to disguise his
pleasure and excitement.</p>

<p>“Well, I fancy that means a victory for us, eh,
Miss Harriet?” he asked. “There’s only one
more event, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the mile run,” answered Harry breathlessly.
“And—oh, where’s my pencil? Quick!
Thank you. Oh, dear! We’ve got to get at least
five points or Hammond will win yet! We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
get first place or second and third! Oh, I don’t
believe we can ever do it! There’s only Dick and
Chase; the others aren’t any good at all! Dick!
Dick! You’ve got to win!”</p>

<p>“Well, from what I’ve heard of him, I think
he’s quite likely to,” said Mr. Kearney smilingly.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been doing very well, though,”
grieved Harry. “You see, he’s had so much to
think about and attend to! I don’t see how it
could be a tie, but if it should—would—do we get
the money?”</p>

<p>“I’d have to think about that,” answered Mr.
Kearney gravely. “You recollect that the terms
called for a victory.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know! But wouldn’t it be awful if we
lost the dormitory by half a point?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it would,” said he, looking smilingly
at her pale face. “Well, I won’t promise, Miss
Harriet, but maybe in that case I might give something,
say a thousand or two. How would that
do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>“It—it would be better than nothing,” answered
Harry without enthusiasm. “Oh, I do
wish they’d hurry!”</p>

<p>“It is a bit uncomfortable, this suspense. We
ought to call this race the Dormitory Stakes, eh?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t too late to cancel that wager, Mr.
Kearney,” laughed the Doctor, leaning across.
But the other shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to, Doctor. That check will be
cheap for a victory over our old rival.”</p>

<p>“There!” cried Harry. “They’re on their
marks! Why, Warren isn’t there! That gives us
only three men! Isn’t it dreadful?”</p>

<p>“Which is Dick Somes?” asked the visitor.
Harry pointed him out with a finger that trembled.</p>

<p>“The big boy with the yellowish hair,” she
whispered. “And the little one is Chase. And
Townsend’s next to him on the left. The boy with
black hair, the one with the cherry-and-black ribbon
across his shirt is Connor! He’s Hammond’s
crack distance runner. I—I hope he won’t win!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>“So do I,” answered Mr. Kearney. “They’re
off!”</p>

<p>The pistol broke sharply on the air and the field
of eight runners leaped forward.</p>

<p>“<em>Oh!</em>” breathed Harry. “It’s four times
around, and I’m just sure I’ll die before they
finish!”</p>

<p>There’s nothing very spectacular about a mile
race. It is rather a test of endurance than of
speed when compared to the middle distances and
sprints, and as the time for the distance is likely
to be somewhere around five minutes the pace is
not fast enough to be inspiring to the spectators.
As the runners took the first corner they seemed
rather to be out for a gentle exercise jog than taking
part in a race which, no matter how it was
won, would decide the fortunes of the day.</p>

<p>Ferry Hill had entered Dick Somes, Chase and
Townsend. Warren had intended to run, but at
the last moment had funked it. For Hammond
there were Connor, Parish, White, Temple and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Frothingham. Connor held the Hammond record
of 5 minutes 7⅗ seconds and Parish was credited
with something very close to that. The other
wearers of the cherry-and-black were unknown
quantities. Dick had done the mile the year before
in about 5 minutes and 6 seconds, but so far
this spring had not been able to come within ten
seconds of that time. Chase was still slower and
Townsend had absolutely no hope of being able
to finish inside the half-minute. But he was going
to be useful.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second lap he pushed to
the front and took the lead, none disputing it with
him. For the next lap he set a hard pace. Connor
was running fifth, with Dick dogging him closely,
stride for stride. At half the distance Townsend
drew aside, badly tuckered, and the lead went to
Temple of Hammond. By this time the eight runners
were strung out for fifty yards, with Temple,
Parish, Chase, Connor and Dick well together in
the van. As they went by the stand on the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
of the third lap the cheering became frantic.
As though in response, Connor suddenly drew out
and passed Chase. But Dick was close after him,
and at the turn they had settled down again.
Temple gave the lead to Parish and gradually
dropped back. Then Chase began to lose and the
hearts of Ferry Hill’s supporters sank. It was
Parish, Connor and Dick now, with Temple and
Chase fighting together yards behind. Then they
were crossing the line and the last lap had begun.</p>

<p>The voices of the judges announcing the fact
were drowned in the shouts of entreaty and encouragement
that broke from the spectators.</p>

<p>“There’s only Dick left!” wailed Harry.
“Chase is out of it entirely! If Dick doesn’t win
we’ll lose! Dick! Dick! Run! You’ve got to
win, Dick!”</p>

<p>But Harry’s frantic entreaty was lost in the
babel of sound and the runners took the turn,
clinging closer to the inner rim of the cinder track.
Around the curve they went, Parish, Connor, Dick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
one close behind the other, heads up, elbows in,
strides matched.</p>

<p>So far Dick had stood the strain well, but now
the work was beginning to tell on him. Breathing
was getting difficult, his knees began to feel a little
bit uncertain and his head displayed a tendency to
drop back. He realized that to win better than
second place was almost out of the question. Both
Connor and Parish were experienced runners,
were conducting the race according to some plan
settled upon between them and were not going to
let their adversary pass if it was possible to prevent
it. And yet if Ferry Hill was to win the meet
it was absolutely necessary for him to reach the
tape ahead of the others. If he came in second
and Chase, by good luck, came in fourth it would
give them four points, just enough to lose by one!
So it was first place or nothing—and Dick began
to think it would be nothing.</p>

<p>He believed that somewhere on the back-stretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Parish would let Connor by and at the same time
try to block the enemy. Connor would then hit up
the pace, Parish would follow if he could and if
not would lag and make it necessary for Dick to
run outside of him; and in the last two hundred
yards of the mile every effort, no matter how
slight, counts. The idea of risking all on a spurt,
passing both opponents and then trying to keep
the lead to the tape occurred to him, but was relinquished.
He believed that he had enough
strength left for a sprint <a href="#image01">at the finish</a>, but he
doubted his ability to make the pace for the rest of
the distance.</p>

<p>The one encouraging thought that can come to
one during a hard race is that your opponent
is probably just as tired and just as worried as
you are. And as Dick followed the others around
the turn into the back-stretch he made the most of
that thought. If his own breath came in scorching
gasps from tired lungs so must that of Connor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Parish; if his own legs ached, so must theirs; if he
was at his wits’ end how to get by them, they were
at their wits’ end how to prevent him.</p>

<p>From across the field came the cheers of the
watchers, but he was scarcely aware of them. His
whole mind was on the race, and he watched Connor
as a cat watches a mouse. For him the only
sounds were the hard breathing of the runners
and the crunch of the cinders under foot. A hundred
yards behind, although he didn’t know it,
Temple and Chase had finished their battle and
the former had won; Chase, with head thrown
back, was following gamely but hopelessly, already
out of the race.</p>

<p>Yard by yard the back-stretch was conquered.
The curve was already at hand and still Dick’s
opponents made no move. The three ran steadily
on, stride for stride. Perhaps they were waiting
for him to try and pass, hoping he would kill himself
in a useless attempt to take the lead. Well,
he’d fool them! Then the wooden rim at his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
began to curve, and suddenly Connor had slipped
from his place with a gasping warning to Parish
and had taken the lead. Dick went after him, but
as soon as he had drawn alongside of Parish that
youth, watching for him, quickly closed up behind
Connor. Dick must either drop back to third place
again or run on the outside, covering more ground
on the turn than the enemy. Well, he was probably
beaten anyway, and so he’d stay where he
was. Perhaps he could cheat Parish out of second
place. So around the turn they went, Connor hugging
the pole in the lead, Parish right behind him
and Dick at his elbow. And now they were on the
home-stretch with the tape and the little knot of
judges and timers scarcely sixty yards away.</p>

<p>But what a distance sixty yards is when seventeen
hundred have gone before it! And what a
deal may happen in that little stretch of cinder
path! The stand was almost deserted and the
spectators were lined along the track almost from
the corner to a point beyond the finish, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
runners came on through a lane of gesticulating
arms, waving flags and caps and frantic noise.</p>

<p>Suddenly Connor’s head tipped back a little.
Dick, watching, saw and realized that the last
struggle had begun. With a gasp for breath to
carry him on, he began his sprint at the same moment
that Connor strove to draw away. A dozen
strides and Parish was no longer beside him. A
dozen more and he was almost even with the Hammond
crack. But now his breath threatened to go
back on him utterly at every aching gasp and his
legs weighed hundreds of pounds. The hope of
victory, born suddenly back there by the turn,
withered under the knowledge of defeat.</p>

<p>Then into his range of vision, standing sharply
out against the confusion of dark figures lining
the track to the right, leaped a girl in a white
dress, a small, slim form with the reddest of hair
and a pale, entreating face. And in the moment
that he saw her her hand shot out toward him
waving a little slip of white paper and beckoning
him on. And in the instant he remembered that
there was more in this than a victory over Hammond;
that on his winning or losing depended the
success of the F. H. S. I. S.! To win meant a new
dormitory for the school; to lose—But he wasn’t
going to lose now!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382-<br />383]</a></span></p>

<p>Stride! Stride! Gasp! Gasp! He had an
idea that Connor had vanished into thin air; at
least he was no longer at his elbow! Faces swept
by like strange blurs. The line was in front of
him, half a dozen yards away. He wondered why
nobody spoke, why everything was so still; then
awoke to the knowledge that the shouting was
deafening. Cries for “Ferry Hill! Ferry Hill!”
for “Hammond! Hammond!” rent the air. Another
stride—another—and then somebody got in
his way and he couldn’t stop and so tumbled over
into somebody’s arms.</p>

<p>He had a dim idea that he was being dragged
across the cinders. Then he had no ideas at all
for a minute. When he got a good, full hold on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
his faculties again he opened his eyes to find Chub
and Roy beside him. He smiled weakly.</p>

<p>“Did I—win?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Two yards to the good!” said Chub. “We’ve
won the meet, Dick, by a point: 66½ to 65½!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried another voice, “<a href="#image17">and something
else, too!</a> Look!”</p>

<p>Harry’s face, flushed, excited and radiant, bent
over him as she held a little slip of white paper
before his eyes. Dick looked and read with dizzy
eyes:</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
